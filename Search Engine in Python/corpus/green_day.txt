Green Day is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of California in 1987 by lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong and bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt. For much of the bands career they have been a trio with a drummer Tre Cool who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 before the recording of the bands second studio album Kerplunk 1991. Touring guitarist Jason White became a fulltime member in 2012 but returned to his role as a touring member in 2016.

Green Day was originally part of the late80s/early90s punk scene at the DIY 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley California. The bands early releases were with the independent record label Lookout Records. In 1994 their majorlabel debut Dookie released through Reprise Records became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day is credited alongside fellow California punk bands NOFX Sublime Bad Religion the Offspring Rancid and Jawbreaker with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S.

Though the albums Insomniac 1995 Nimrod 1997 and Warning 2000 did not match the success of Dookie they were still successful with the former two reaching double platinum status while the latter achieved gold. Green Days seventh album a rock opera called American Idiot 2004 found popularity with a younger generation selling six million copies in the US. Their next album 21st Century Breakdown was released in 2009 and achieved the bands best chart performance. It was followed by a trilogy of albums Uno Dos and Tre released in September November and December 2012 respectively. The trilogy did not perform as well as expected commercially in comparison to their previous albums largely due to lack of promotion and Armstrong entering rehab. Their twelfth studio album Revolution Radio was released in October 2016 and became their third to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. The bands thirteenth studio album Father of All Motherfuckers was released on February 7 2020.
