The Rolling Stones were at the forefront of the British Invasion of bands that became popular in the United States in 1964 and were identified with the youthful and rebellious counterculture of the 1960s. Rooted in blues and early rock and roll the band started out playing covers but found more success with their own material; songs such as I Cant Get No Satisfaction and Paint It Black became international hits and Aftermath 1966 their first entirely original album  has been considered the most important of the bands formative records.[1] After a short period of experimentation with psychedelic rock in the mid1960s the Stones returned to their bluesy roots with Beggars Banquet 1968 Let It Bleed 1969 Sticky Fingers 1971 and Exile on Main St. 1972. It was during this period they were first introduced on stage as The Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World.
