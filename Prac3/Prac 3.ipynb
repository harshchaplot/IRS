       "'definitions\\nin his book form in tonal music, douglass m. green distinguishes between genre and form. he lists madrigal, motet, canzona, ricercar, and dance as examples of genres from the renaissance period. to further clarify the meaning of genre, green writes, \"beethoven\\'s op. 61 and mendelssohn\\'s op. 64 are identical in genre—both are violin concertos—but different in form. however, mozart\\'s rondo for piano, k. 511, and the agnus dei from his mass, k. 317, are quite different in genre but happen to be similar in form.\"[3] some, like peter van der merwe, treat the terms genre and style as the same, saying that genre should be defined as pieces of music that share a certain style or \"basic musical language.\"[4]\\n\\nothers, such as allan f. moore, state that genre and style are two separate terms, and that secondary characteristics such as subject matter can also differentiate between genres.[5] a music genre or subgenre may also be defined by the musical techniques, the cultural context, and the content and spirit of the themes. geographical origin is sometimes used to identify a music genre, though a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of subgenres. timothy laurie argues that, since the early 1980s, \"genre has graduated from being a subset of popular music studies to being an almost ubiquitous framework for constituting and evaluating musical research objects\".[6]\\n\\nmusicologists have sometimes classified music according to a trichotomous distinction such as philip tagg\\'s \"axiomatic triangle consisting of \\'folk\\', \\'art\\' and \\'popular\\' musics\".[7] he explains that each of these three is distinguishable from the others according to certain criteria.[7]\\n\\nalternatively, music can be assessed on the three dimensions of \"arousal\", \"valence\", and \"depth\".[8] arousal reflects physiological processes such as stimulation and relaxation (intense, forceful, abrasive, thrilling vs. gentle, calming, mellow), valence reflects emotion and mood processes (fun, happy, lively, enthusiastic, joyful vs. depressing, sad), and depth reflects cognitive processes (intelligent, sophisticated, inspiring, complex, poetic, deep, emotional, thoughtful vs. party music, danceable).[8] these help explain why many people like similar songs from different traditionally segregated genres.[8]\\n\\nart music\\nmain article: art music\\nsee also: list of art music traditions\\nart music primarily includes classical traditions, including both contemporary and historical classical music forms. art music exists in many parts of the world. it emphasizes formal styles that invite technical and detailed deconstruction[9] and criticism, and demand focused attention from the listener. in western practice, art music is considered primarily a written musical tradition,[10] preserved in some form of music notation rather than being transmitted orally, by rote, or in recordings, as popular and traditional music usually are.[10][11] historically, most western art music has been written down using the standard forms of music notation that evolved in europe, beginning well before the renaissance and reaching its maturity in the romantic period.\\n\\nthe identity of a \"work\" or \"piece\" of art music is usually defined by the notated version rather than by a particular performance and is primarily associated with the composer rather than the performer (though composers may leave performers with some opportunity for interpretation or improvisation). this is so particularly in the case of western classical music. art music may include certain forms of jazz, though some feel that jazz is primarily a form of popular music. the 1960s saw a wave of avant-garde experimentation in free jazz, represented by artists such as ornette coleman, sun ra, albert ayler, archie shepp and don cherry.[12] and avant-garde rock artists such as frank zappa, captain beefheart, and the residents released art music albums.\\n\\npopular music\\nmain article: popular music\\n\\njennifer lopez performing at a pop music festival\\npopular music is any musical style accessible to the general public and disseminated by the mass media. musicologist and popular music specialist philip tagg defined the notion in the light of sociocultural and economical aspects:\\n\\npopular music, unlike art music, is (1) conceived for mass distribution to large and often socioculturally heterogeneous groups of listeners, (2) stored and distributed in non-written form, (3) only possible in an industrial monetary economy where it becomes a commodity and (4) in capitalist societies, subject to the laws of \\'free\\' enterprise ... it should ideally sell as much as possible.[7]\\n\\npopular music is found on most commercial and public service radio stations, in most commercial music retailers and department stores, and movie and television soundtracks. it is noted on the billboard charts and, in addition to singer-songwriters and composers, it involves music producers more than other genres do.\\n\\nthe distinction between classical and popular music has sometimes been blurred in marginal areas[13] such as minimalist music and light classics. background music for films/movies often draws on both traditions. in this respect, music is like fiction, which likewise draws a distinction between literary fiction and popular fiction that is not always precise.\\n\\nrock music\\nmain article: rock music\\nrock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as \"rock and roll\" in the united states in the early 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the united kingdom and in the united states.\\n\\nelectronic music\\nmain article: electronic music § rise of popular electronic music\\nelectronic dance music saw further rise[clarification needed] in early 21st-century pop

music, originating from the late 1960s jamaica, is a genre of music that was originally used by jamaicans to define themselves with their lifestyle and social aspects.[16] the meaning behind reggae songs tend to be about love, faith or a higher power, and freedom.[17] reggae music is important to jamaican culture as it has been used as inspiration for many third world liberation movements. bob marley, an artist primarily known for reggae music, was honored by zimbabwe\\'s 1980 independence celebration due to his music giving inspirations to freedom fighters. the music genre of reggae is known to incorporate different stylistic techniques form rhythm and blues, jazz, african, caribbean, and other genres as well but what makes reggae unique are the vocals and lyrics.[citation needed] the vocals tend to be sung in jamaican patois, jamaican english, and iyaric dialects. the lyrics of reggae music usually tend to raise political awareness and on cultural perspectives.[18]\\n\\nhip

specifically the south bronx in the new york city by african-american youth from the inner cities during the 1970s. it can be broadly defined as a stylized rhythmic music that commonly accompanies rapping,[19] a rhythmic and rhyming speech that is chanted.[20] hip hop music derives from the hip hop culture itself, including four key elements: emceeing (mcing)/rapping, disc jockeying (djing)

(may 2019) (learn how and when to remove this template message)\\na picture of a red and black button accordion\\npiano accordion: italian instrument used in several different cultures\\ntraditional and folk music are very similar categories. although the traditional music is a very broad category and can include several different genres, it is widely accepted that traditional music encompasses folk music.[22] according to the ictm (international council for traditional music), traditional music are songs and tunes that have been performed over a long period of time (usually several generations). [23]\\n\\nthe folk music genre is classified as the music that is orally passed from one generation to another. usually the artist is unknown, and there are several different versions of the same song.[24] the genre is transmitted by singing, listening and dancing to popular songs. this type of communication allows culture to transmit the styles (pitches and cadences) as well as the context it was developed.[25]\\n\\nculturally transmitting folk songs maintain rich evidence about the period of history when they were created and the social class in which they developed.[26] some examples of the folk genre can be seen in the folk music of england and turkish folk music. english folk music has developed since the medieval period and has been transmitted from that time until today. similarly, turkish folk music relates to all the civilizations that once passed thorough turkey, thereby being a world reference since the east–west tensions during the early modern period.\\n\\ntraditional folk music usually refers to songs composed in the twentieth century, which tend to be written as universal truths and big issues of the time they were composed.[27] artists including bob dylan; peter, paul and mary; james taylor; and leonard cohen transformed folk music to what it is known today.[28] newer composers such as ed sheeran (pop folk) and the lumineers (american folk) are examples of contemporary folk music, which has been recorded and adapted to the new way of listening to music (online)—unlike the traditional way of orally transmitting music.[29]\\n\\neach country in the world, in some cases each region, district and community, has its own folk music style. the different sub-divisions of folk genre are developed by each place, cultural identity and history.[30] because the music is developed in different places, many of the instruments are characteristic to location and population—but some are used everywhere: button or piano accordion, different types of flutes or trumpets, banjo, and ukulele. both french and scottish folk music use related instruments such as the fiddle, the harp and variations of bagpipes.[31][32]\\nautomatic categorization\\nmain articles: automatic content recognition and music information retrieval\\n[icon]\\t\\nthis section needs expansion. you can help by adding to it. (february 2014)\\nautomatic methods of musical similarity detection, based on data mining and co-occurrence analysis, have been developed to classify music titles for electronic music distribution.[33]\\n\\nemergence of new genres and sub-genres\\nfor more information, see fusion (music).\\nnew genres can arise through the development of new forms and styles of music and also simply by creating a new categorization. although it is conceivable to create a musical style with no relation to existing genres, new styles usually appear under the influence of pre-existing genres.\\n\\nthe genealogy of musical genres expresses, often in the form of a written chart, how new genres have developed under the influence of older ones. if two or more existing genres influence the emergence of a new one, a fusion between them can be said to have taken place. the proliferation of popular music in the 20th century has led to over 1,200 definable sub-genres of music.[34] examples of fusion genres include jazz fusion, which is a fusion of jazz and rock music, and country rock which is a fusion of country music and rock music.\\norigins\\nthe roots of modern bhangra music date back to england in the 1960s. an early pop music and modern recording artist/group of this type of music in the uk was bhujhangy group, founded by brothers balbir singh khanpur and dalbir singh khanpur in birmingham in 1967.[1] bhujhangy group\\'s first major hit was \"bhabiye akh larr gayee\" in the early 1980s, released on birmingham\\'s oriental star agencies label. this was the first song to combine traditional asian music with modern western instruments, which would be followed by further developments of this in bhangra.[2]\\n\\nunited kingdom\\n1970s\\n\\nlive concert by bhangra band alaap\\na modern and commercial form of bhangra music was said to rise in britain in the 1970s by punjabi immigrants who took their native folk music and began experimenting by altering it using instruments from their host country. the new genre quickly became popular in britain replacing punjabi folk singers due to it being heavily influenced in britain by the infusion of rock music and a need to move away from the simple and repetitive punjabi folk music. it indicated the development of a self-conscious and distinctively rebellious british asian youth culture centred on an experiential sense of self, e.g., language, gesture, bodily signification, desires, etc., in a situation in which tensions with british culture and racist elements in british society had resulted in alienation in many minority ethnic groups, fostered a sense of need for an affirmation of a positive identity and culture, and provided a platform for british punjabi males to assert their masculinity.[3][4][5][6]\\n\\nin the 1980s, distributed by record labels such as multitone records, bhangra artists were selling over 30,000 cassettes a week in the uk, but no artists reached the top 40 uk chart despite these artists outselling popular british ones; most of the bhangra cassette sales were not through the large uk record stores, whose sales were those recorded by the official uk charts company for creating their rankings.[7]\\n\\nthe group alaap (band) formed in 1977, co-founded by channi singh and harjeet gandhi who both hailed from southall, a punjabi area in london. their album teri chunni de sitaray was released in 1982 by multitone. alaap was considered the first and original superstar bhangra band formed in the united kingdom. channi singh has been awarded the obe by the queen for his services to bhangra music and services/charity for the british asian community. co-founder harjeet gandhi died in 2003.[8]\\n\\nthe 1980s is commonly known as the golden age, or the age of bhangra music, which lasted roughly from 1985 to 1993. the primary emphasis during these times was on the melody/riff, played out usually on a synthesizer, harmonium, accordion or a guitar. the folk instruments were rarely used.\\n\\none of the biggest bhangra stars of the last several decades is malkit singh and his band golden star. singh was born in june 1963 in the village of hussainpur in punjab. he attended the lyallpur khalsa college, jalandhar, in punjab in 1980 to study for a bachelor of arts degree. there he met his mentor, professor inderjit singh, who taught him punjabi folk singing and bhangra dancing. due to singh\\'s tutelage, malkit entered and won song contests during this time. in 1983, he won a gold medal at the guru nanak dev university in amritsar, punjab, for performing his song \"gurh nalon ishq mitha\", which later featured on his first album, nach gidhe wich, released in 1984. this album was created with the assistance of bhangra musician, tarlochan singh bilga. the band has toured 27 countries. malkit has been awarded the mbe by the queen for his services to bhangra music.\\n\\nbhangra boy band, the sahotas, were composed of five brothers from wolverhampton. their music is a fusion of bhangra, rock and dance.\\n\\nheera, formed by bhupinder bhindi and fronted by kumar and dhami, was one of the most popular bands of the 1980s.[9][10] the group established itself with the albums jag wala mela, produced by kuljit bhamra, and diamonds from heera, produced by deepak khazanchi, on arishma records. these albums are notable for being amongst the first bhangra albums to mix punjabi drums and punjabi synthesizers with traditional british instruments successfully.\\n\\nbands like alaap and heera incorporated rock-influenced beats into bhangra, because it enabled \"asian youth to affirm their identities positively\" within the broader environment of alternative rock as an alternative way of expression. however, some believe that the progression of bhangra music created an \"intermezzo culture\" post-india\\'s partition, within the unitary definitions of southeast asians within the diaspora, thus \"establishing a brand new community in their home away from home\".[11]\\n\\nseveral other influential groups appeared around the same time, including the saathies, premi group, bhujungy group, and apna sangeet. apna sangeet, best known for their hit \"mera yaar vajavey dhol\", re-formed for charity in may 2009 after a break-up.[12]\\n\\nwhen bhangra and general indian sounds and lyrics were combined, british-asian artists began incorporating them in their music. some asian artists, such as mick st clair, bally sagoo, talvin singh, badmarsh, black star liner are creating their own form of british hip-hop.\\n\\nthis era also brought about bhangra art, which like the bhangra music it represented was rebellious. unlike folk music art, which consisted of a picture of the folk singer, bhangra recordings had details such as distinctive artwork, logos, clever album names and band/musician listings (who played what).\\n\\nfolk backlash\\nin the mid-1990s, however, many artists returned to the original, traditional folk beats away from bhangra music, often incorporating more dhol drum beats and tumbi. this time also saw the rise of several young punjabi folk singers as a backlash to bhangra music. they were aided by djs who mixed hip hop samples with folk singing.\\n\\nbeginning around 1994, there was a trend towards the use of samples (often sampled from mainstream hip hop) mixed with traditional folk rhythm instruments, such as the tumbi and dhol. using folk instruments and hip-hop samples, along with relatively inexpensive folk vocals imported from punjab, punjabi folk music was able to cause the decline of bhangra music.\\n\\npioneering djs instrumental in the decline of bhangra were mick st clair, bally sagoo and panjabi mc. as djs who were initially hired by bhangra labels to remix the original recordings on the label\\'s roster (osa and nachural respectively), they along with the record labels quickly found that remixing folk singers from india was much cheaper than working with outsourced bhangra bands.\\n\\na pioneering folk singer that was instrumental in bhangra\\'s demise was jazzy b, who debuted in 1992. having sold over 55,000 copies of his third album, folk and funky, he is now one of the best-selling punjabi folk artists in the world, with a vocal style likened to that of kuldip manak.\\n\\nother influential folk artists include surinder shinda - famous for his \"putt jattan de\" - harbhajan mann, manmohan waris, meshi eshara, sarbjit cheema, hans raj hans, sardool sikander, anakhi, sat rang, xlnc, b21, shaktee, sahara, paaras, pdm, amar group, sangeet group, bombay talkie, and late alam lohar contributions of notably jugni and mirza sahiban. a dj to rise to stardom with many successful hits was panjabi mc.\\n\\nby the end of the 1990s, bhangra music had largely declined and been replaced with punjabi folk singers. the same folk singers which bhangra bands had replaced a decade earlier were being utilized by djs to make relatively inexpensive live music on laptops. this \"folkhop\" genre was short lived as records could not be officially released due to nonclearance copyrights on samples used to create the \"beat\". this continued until the end of the century. folk-hop record labels such as hi-tech were investigated by bpi (british phonographic industry) for copyright infringement by way of uncleared samples on releases by folk djs such as dj sanj.[13]\\n\\ntoward the end of the decade, bhangra continued to decline, with folk-hop artists such as bally sagoo and apache indian signing with international recording labels sony and island. moreover, multitone records, one of the major recording labels associated with bhangra in britain in the 1980s and 1990s, was bought by bmg. a recent[when?] pepsi

there are some children and young adults who have maintained their folk roots. another reason why some fans express an anti-folk sentiment is that many folk songs were written for the dominate jatts clan whereas sikhs do not believe in castes, so they disapproved of punjabi folk music. however, today with artists like tru-skool, jazzy b, pmc, sukhshinder shinda, surinder shinda, pappi gill, nachattar gill, pammi bai and diljit dosanjh, punjabi folk has increased in popularity although it is fused in some cases[vague]. itunes has catalogs of many punjabi folk singers available.\\n\\nanother cause of the resurgence of punjabi folk music is due to the increased popularity of bhangra in areas like the uk, canada and u.s. bhangra has become more accessible through social media platforms such as youtube and instagram, for the younger generation. in addition, multiple universities, across the uk, us and canada have teams as well as academies being set up by senior dancers separate from universities. this resurgence has led to a desire for more traditional folk songs and beats, but also a learning opportunity for children of their cultures.\\norigins\\nfurther information: music of bollywood\\nin the earliest years, filmi music was generally indian (classical carnatic, hindustani, and village folk) in inspiration; over the years, western elements have increased significantly.[citation needed] however, film soundtracks continue to be very diverse, sometimes fusing genres or reverting to entirely classical music. examples of this can be found throughout the history of filmi music.\\n\\nmusic directors\\nmain article: indian film music directors\\nr. c. boral, harishchandra bali, pankaj mullick, anil biswas, naushad ali, khwaja khurshid anwar and s. rajeswara rao were noteworthy music directors of the 1940s. rao, who scored the 1948 tamil chandralekha, the first all-india hit, continued music directing in chennai until the 1980s. the 1950s and 1960s, included music composers like shankar jaikishan, s. d. burman, o. p. nayyar, madan mohan, hemant kumar, c. ramchandra, roshan, vasant desai, kalyanji–anandji[3] and khayyam in hindi film music. k. v. mahadevan, vishwanathan-ramamoorthy, laxmikant–pyarelal, g. devarajan, v. dakshinamoorthy and m. s. viswanathan were active music directors for more than 35 years from the 1950s.\\n\\nas indian cinema segued into the 1960s and 1970s, pop artists like r. d. burman, bappi lahiri and duos like nadeem–shravan and jatin–lalit gave filmi a stronger western flavor with composers ilaiyaraaja and raveendran who rose to fame during the 1970s and 1980s in tamil film music.\\n\\nmajor musical forces in the 1990s and 2000s have included a. r. rahman, nadeem–shravan, pritam, himesh reshammiya, harris jayaraj, shankar–ehsaan–loy, vishal–shekhar, vidyasagar, ramesh narayan, m. jayachandran, yuvan shankar raja, deepak dev, johnson, anu malik, nusrat fateh ali khan, salim–sulaiman, devi sri prasad etc. a. r. rahman, who was described by time magazine as \"india\\'s most prominent movie songwriter,\"[4] is widely accepted to be the most internationally recognized indian musician.\\n\\nplayback singers\\nmain articles: list of indian playback singers and playback singer\\na playback singer is a singer who pre-records songs for use in films. the singer records the song and the actors or actresses lip-sync the song in front of the cameras, a form of singing that is characteristic of the indian subcontinent. the songs of a film, the quality of the music and its music director (composer), lyricist and singer have often determined the success of a film. film soundtracks are sometimes released before the film itself, resulting in a disparity between the soundtrack and the songs appearing in the film.\\n\\nkundan lal saigal was one of the earliest playback singers in the indian music industry.[citation needed] notable playback singers include lata mangeshkar, asha bhosle, mohammed rafi, kishore kumar, mukesh, s. p. balasubrahmanyam, k. j. yesudas, s. janaki, p. susheela, k. s. chithra, udit narayan, alka yagnik, kumar sanu, armaan malik, sonu nigam, shaan, kk, shreya ghoshal, arijit singh, mohit chauhan, javed ali, neha kakkar and many others.\\n\\nlyricists\\nmain article: hindi songs\\nin the 1950s and \\'60s, lyricists like shailendra, hasrat jaipuri, sahir ludhianvi, raja mehdi ali khan, rajendra krishan, majrooh sultanpuri, bharat vyas, shakeel badayuni, qamar jalalabadi, anand bakshi, jan nisar akhtar and s. h. bihari wrote lyrics of many classic filmi songs. lyrics tended towards the literary and drew heavily on contemporary urdu and hindi poetry. the south has seen poets like kannadasan, vairamuthu and vaali rise to prominence, in tamil poetry and literature alongside vayalar ramavarma, p. bhaskaran, o. n. v. kurup in the malayalam music industry.[citation needed]\\n\\npopularity ratings\\nbinaca geetmala, ameen sayani\\'s popular hindi language radio show before satellite television took over in india sometime in the 1990s, gave weekly popularity ratings of hindi film songs (akin to the billboard hot 100 list of songs). it ran in various incarnations from 1952 to 1993, and annual lists of the most popular songs were played at year-end. the list was compiled on the basis of record sales in india.[5] currently, hindi filmi songs are sold on tape and cd compilations, played as promos and in programs on various television channels and radio stations, with different popularity ratings claiming different songs as being on the top. in an annual exercise, a net-based effort rmim puraskaar lists all important hindi film songs of the year, in addition to awarding songs for various categories.\\n\\naccusations of plagiarism\\nbecause popular music directors score a great many films over the course of a year, accusations of plagiarizing abound. for example, one production number in dil (1990) is based on carl perkins\\' blue suede shoes, sung with hindi lyrics. of late the indian film industry has been gaining visibility outside india, and the legal risks of plagiarism have been gaining importance. some producers have actually paid for the musical rights to popular western songs, as in kal ho naa ho\\'s (2003) song, \"oh, pretty woman\". plagiarism has also existed within india, with several music directors in bombay cinema lifting tunes from other \"regional\" industries.\\n\\nthere have also been accusations of plagiarism against foreigner musicians borrowing from hindi filmi songs. for example, \"don\\'t phunk with my heart\" by the black eyed peas was largely based on two 1970s filmi songs: \"ye mera dil yaar ka diwana\" from don (1978) and \"ae naujawan hai sab kuchh yahan\" from apradh (1972).[6] both songs were originally composed by kalyanji anandji and sung by asha bhosle.[7] another example is \"addictive\" sung by truth hurts, which is lifted from lata mangeshkar\\'s \"thoda resham lagta hai\" from jyoti (1981). this led to the copyright holders of the original song filing a lawsuit against dj quik and dr. dre, the producers of \"addictive\".[8] filmi music composed by a. r. rahman (who would later win two academy awards for the slumdog millionaire soundtrack) has frequently been sampled by musicians elsewhere in the world, including the singaporean artist kelly poon, the uzbek artist iroda dilroz, the french rap group la caution, the american artist ciara, and the german band löwenherz,[9] among others.\\n\\nwider success\\nfilmi is also making converts and exerting influence beyond the usual desi audiences, with many western music stores today carrying indian music compilations. as early as 1978, the synthpop pioneers haruomi hosono and ryuichi sakamoto of the yellow magic orchestra produced an electronic album cochin moon based on an experimental fusion between electronic music and bollywood-inspired indian music.[10] later in 1988, devo\\'s hit song \"disco dancer\" was inspired by the song \"i am a disco dancer\" from the bollywood film disco dancer (1982).[11]\\n\\nbaz luhrmann showcases the song \"chamma chamma\" from china gate (1998) in his 2001 movie moulin rouge. another 2001 film ghost world featured mohammed rafi\\'s song \"jaan pehechan ho\" from the 1965 film gumnaam. the 2002 song \"addictive\", sung by truth hurts and produced by dj quik and dr. dre, was lifted from lata mangeshkar\\'s \"thoda resham lagta hai\" from jyoti (1981).[8] the black eyed peas\\' grammy award winning 2005 song \"don\\'t phunk with my heart\" was inspired by two 1970s bollywood songs: \"ye mera dil yaar ka diwana\" from don (1978) and \"ae naujawan hai sab kuchh yahan\" from apradh (1972).[6] both songs were originally composed by kalyanji anandji, sung by asha bhosle, and featured the dancer helen.[7] the songs \"mera man tera pyasa\" from the movie gambler (1971) performed by mohammed rafi, \"tere sang pyar main\" from the movie nagin (1976) performed by lata mangeshkar, and \"wada na tod\" also by lata mangeshkar from the movie dil tujhko diya (1987) were featured in eternal sunshine of the spotless mind (2004). scores from chennai tamil films have appeared in productions such as lord of war (2005) and the accidental husband (2008). ilaiyaraaja won the gold remi award for best music score jointly with film composer m. s. viswanathan at the worldfest-houston film festival for the tamil film vishwa thulasi (2005).[12]\\n\\na. r. rahman rose to fame from the chennai film industry to become one of the most popular international music directors and has had a musicalbombay dreams, playing in london and new york, and scored several projects outside india. he has won two academy awards and two grammy awards, even numerous international awards and accolades. the song \"chaiyya chaiyya\", originally composed by a. r. rahman for dil se.. (1998), has also been well received around the world, making several top 10 world music lists and has even been featured in several american movies. the song was in both the opening scene and credits of spike lee\\'s inside man. rahman\\'s earlier soundtrack for roja (1991) was included in time\\'s 10 best soundtracks of all time in 2005. he has been regarded as the only composer from india to attain massive popularity and fame in the international arena.[13][14][15] hindi filmi music has reached an even wider global audience due to the success of the slumdog millionaire soundtrack, also composed by rahman.\\n\\nthe first domain name ever registered related to filmi music and indian entertainment media was indiamusic.com. the site further put filmi music on the map. thereafter followed a flood of indian and filmi music sites.\\nlavani is a genre of music popular in maharashtra, india.[1] lavani is a combination of traditional song and dance, which particularly performed to the beats of dholki, a percussion instrument. lavani is noted for its powerful rhythm. lavani has contributed substantially to the development of marathi folk theatre.[2] in maharashtra and southern madhya pradesh, it is performed by the female performers wearing nine-yard long sarees. the songs are sung in a quick tempo.\\n\\n\\ncontents\\n1\\tetymology\\n2\\thistory and genres\\n3\\tdress-up\\n4\\treferences\\n5\\texternal links\\netymology\\naccording to a tradition, the word lavani is derived from the word lavanya which means beauty. according to another tradition, it is derived from marathi lavene\\n\\nhistory and genres\\ntraditionally, this genre of folk dance deals with different and varied subject matters such as society,[3] religion and politics. the songs in \\'lavani\\' are mostly erotic in sentiment and the dialogues tend to be pungent in socio-political satire.[4] originally, it was used as a form of entertainment and morale booster to the tired soldiers. lavani songs, which are sung along with dance, are usually naughty and erotic in nature. it is believed their origin is in the prakrit gathas collected by hala.[5] the nirguni lavani (philosophical) and the shringari lavani (sensual) are the two types. the devotional music of the nirguni cult is popular all over malwa.\\n\\nlavani developed into two distinct performances, namely phadachi lavani and baithakichi lavani. the lavani sung and enacted in a public performance before a large audience in a theatrical atmosphere is called phadachi lavani. and, when the lavani is sung in a closed chamber for a private and select audience by a girl sitting before the audience, it came to be known as baithakichi lavani.\\n\\ndress-up\\nthe ladies that perform lavani wear a long sari length around 9 yards. they form a bun (juda in hindi or ambada in marathi) with their hair. they wear heavy jewellery that includes necklace, earrings, payal, kamarpatta (a belt at the waist), bangles etc. they usually put a large bindi of dark red color on their forehead. the sari they wear is called nauvari. the sari is wrapped and is more comfortable as compared to other sari types.[6]\\n\\n\"the main subject matter of the lavani is the love between man and woman in various forms. married wife\\'s menstruation, sexual union between husband and wife, their love, soldier\\'s amorous exploits, the wife\\'s bidding farewell to the husband who is going to join the war, pangs of separation, adulterous love - the intensity of adulterous passion, childbirth: these are all the different themes of the lavani. the lavani poet out-steps the limits of social decency and control when it comes to the depiction of sexual passion.\" k. ayyappapanicker, sahitya akademi[7]\\n\\nthere are also men that dance in lavni along with the ladies. they are the called nat (male dancer) usually the kinnars. these men dance in support with the lead dancer.\\n\\nalthough the beginnings of lavani can be traced back to the 1560s, it came into prominence during the later days of the peshwa rule. several celebrated marathi shahir poet-singers, which include parasharam (1754-1844), ram joshi (1762–1812), anant fandi (1744-1819), honaji bala (1754-1844), prabhakar (1769-1843), saganbhau and lok shahir annabhau sathe (1 august 1920 – 18 july 1969) has contributed significantly for the development of this genre of music. lokshahir bashir momin kavathekar is the popular present day shaheer/ poet of lavani whose compositions are presented on stage by surekha punekar, sandhya mane, roshan satrkar and many tamasha troupes since the early 1980s. honaji bala introduced tabla in place of the traditional dholki. he also developed the baithakichi lavani, a subgenre, which is presented by the singer in the seated position.\\n\\nsatyabhamabai pandharpurkar and yamunabai waikar are the popular present day exponents of lavani.\\n\\nshringar lavani is mostly sung and danced on the stage by a female and written by male. vithabai narayangaonkar, kantabai satarkar, surekha punekar,managala bansode, sandhya mane, roshan satarkar are well known artiste presenting lavani on stage. lavani can also be termed as a romantic song sung by lady who is waiting for her lover to accept her, who longs for his love. many lavani dancers are from some castes of maharashtra like mahar kolhati, and matang.\\n\\nmarathi films played an important role in making the lavani genre accessible to masses. movies such as pinjara and natarang not only attempted to blend traditional music with social messages but also helped portray lavani world in positive light.\\nhistory\\naround the 12th century, hindustani classical music diverged from what eventually came to be identified as carnatic classical music. hindustani music places more emphasis on improvisation and exploring all aspects of a raga, while carnatic music is primarily composition-based. the central notion in both these systems is that of a melodic musical mode or raga, sung to a rhythmic cycle or tala. it is melodic music, with no concept of harmony. these principles were refined in the musical treatises natya shastra, by bharata (2nd–3rd century ce), and dattilam (probably 3rd–4th century ce).[1]\\n\\nin medieval times, the melodic systems were fused with ideas from persian music, particularly through the influence of sufi composers like amir khusro, and later in the mughal courts, noted composers such as tansen flourished, along with religious groups like the vaishnavites.\\n\\nafter the 16th century, the singing styles diversified into different gharanas patronized in different princely courts. around 1900, vishnu narayan bhatkhande consolidated the musical structures of hindustani classical music, called ragas, into a few thaats based on their notes. this is a very flawed system but is somewhat useful as a heuristic.\\n\\ndistinguished musicians who are hindu may be addressed as pandit and those who are muslim as ustad. an aspect of hindustani music going back to sufi times is the tradition of religious neutrality: muslim ustads may sing compositions in praise of hindu deities and vice versa.\\n\\ncharacteristics\\nindian classical music has seven basic notes with five interspersed half-notes, resulting in a 12-note scale. unlike the 12-note scale in western music, the base frequency of the scale is not fixed, and intertonal gaps (temperament) may also vary. the performance is set to a melodic pattern called a raga characterized in part by specific ascent (aroha) and descent (avaroha) sequences, \"king\" (vadi) and \"queen\" (samavadi) notes and characteristic phrases (pakad).[citation needed]\\n\\nragas may originate from any source, including religious hymns, folk tunes, and music from outside the indian subcontinent[citation needed]. for example, raga khamaj and its variants have been classicized from folk music, while ragas such as hijaz (also called basant mukhari) originated in persian maqams.\\n\\nhistory\\nsanskritic tradition\\nravana and narada from hindu mythology are accomplished musicians; saraswati with her veena is the goddess of music. gandharvas are presented as spirits who are musical masters, and the gandharva style looks to music primarily for pleasure, accompanied by the soma rasa. in the vishnudharmottara purana, the naga king ashvatara asks to know the swaras from saraswati[citation needed].\\n\\nwhile the term raga is articulated in the natya shastra (where its meaning is more literal, meaning \"colour\" or \"mood\"), it finds a clearer expression in what is called jati in the dattilam, a text composed shortly after or around the same time as natya shastra. the dattilam is focused on gandharva music and discusses scales (swara), defining a tonal framework called grama in terms of 22 micro-tonal intervals (sruti[2]) comprising one octave. it also discusses various arrangements of the notes (murchhana), the permutations and combinations of note-sequences (tanas), and alankara or elaboration. dattilam categorizes melodic structure into 18 groups called jati, which are the fundamental melodic structures similar to the raga. the names of the jatis reflect regional origins, for example andhri and oudichya[citation needed].\\n\\nmusic also finds mention in a number of texts from the gupta period; kalidasa mentions several kinds of veena (parivadini, vipanchi), as well as percussion instruments (mridang), the flute (vamshi) and conch (shankha). music also finds mention in buddhist and jain texts from the earliest periods of the common era[citation needed].\\n\\nnarada\\'s sangita makarandha treatise, from about 1100 ce, is the earliest text where rules similar to those of current hindustani classical music can be found. narada actually names and classifies the system in its earlier form before the persian influences introduced changes in the system. jayadeva\\'s gita govinda from the 12th century was perhaps the earliest musical composition sung in the classical tradition called ashtapadi music[citation needed].\\n\\nin the 13th century, sharngadeva composed the sangita ratnakara, which has names such as the turushka todi (\"turkish todi\"), revealing an influx of ideas from islamic culture. this text is the last to be mentioned by both the carnatic and the hindustani traditions and is often thought to date the divergence between the two.\\n\\nhindustani music’s influence during the delhi sultanate\\nthe advent of islamic rule under the delhi sultanate and later the mughal empire over northern india caused considerable cultural interchange. increasingly, musicians received patronage in the courts of the new rulers, who in their turn, started taking an increasing interest in local musical forms. while the initial generations may have been rooted in cultural traditions outside india, they gradually adopted many aspects from the hindu culture from their kingdoms. this helped spur the fusion of hindu and muslim ideas to bring forth new forms of musical synthesis like qawwali and khyal.\\n\\nthe most influential musician of the delhi sultanate period was amir khusrau (1253–1325), a composer in persian, turkish, arabic, as well as braj bhasha. he is credited with systematizing some aspects of hindustani music, and also introducing several ragas such as yaman kalyan, zeelaf and sarpada. he created six genres of music: khyal, tarana, naqsh, gul, qaul, and qalbana. a number of instruments (such as the sitar) were also introduced in his time.\\n\\namir khusrau is sometimes credited with the origins of the khyal form, but the record of his compositions do not appear to support this. the compositions by the court musician sadarang in the court of muhammad shah bear a closer affinity to the modern khyal. they suggest that while khyal already existed in some form, sadarang may have been the father of modern khyal.\\n\\nmuch of the musical forms innovated by these pioneers merged with the hindu tradition, composed in the popular language of the people (as opposed to sanskrit) in the work of composers like kabir or nanak. this can be seen as part of a larger bhakti tradition, (strongly related to the vaishnavite movement) which remained influential across several centuries; notable figures include jayadeva (11th century), vidyapati (fl. 1375 ce), chandidas (14th–15th century), and meerabai (1555–1603 ce).\\n\\nas the mughal empire came into closer contact with hindus, especially under jalal ud-din akbar, music and dance also flourished. in particular, the musician tansen introduced a number of innovations, including ragas and particular compositions. legend has it that upon his rendition of a night-time raga in the morning, the entire city fell under a hush and clouds gathered in the sky and that he could light fires by singing the raga \"deepak\".\\n\\nat the royal house of gwalior, raja mansingh tomar (1486–1516 ce) also participated in the shift from sanskrit to the local idiom (hindi) as the language for classical songs. he himself penned several volumes of compositions on religious and secular themes and was also responsible for the major compilation, the mankutuhal (\"book of curiosity\"), which outlined the major forms of music prevalent at the time. in particular, the musical form known as dhrupad saw considerable development in his court and remained a strong point of the gwalior gharana for many centuries.\\n\\nafter the dissolution of the mughal empire, the patronage of music continued in smaller princely kingdoms like awadh, patiala, and banaras, giving rise to the diversity of styles that is today known as gharanas. many musician families obtained large grants of land which made them self-sufficient, at least for a few generations (e.g. the sham chaurasia gharana). meanwhile, the bhakti and sufi traditions continued to develop and interact with the different gharanas and groups.\\n\\nmodern era\\nuntil the late 19th century, hindustani classical music was imparted on a one-on-one basis through the guru-shishya (\"mentor-protégé\") tradition. this system had many benefits, but also several drawbacks; in many cases, the shishya had to spend most of his time serving his guru with a hope that the guru might teach him a \"cheez\" (piece or nuance) or two. in addition, the system forced the music to be limited to a small subsection of the indian community. to a large extent, it was limited to the palaces and dance halls. it was shunned by the intellectuals, avoided by the educated middle class, and in general, looked down upon as a frivolous practice.[3]\\n\\nfirst, as the power of the maharajahs and nawabs declined in the early 20th century, so did their patronage. with the expulsion of wajid ali shah to calcutta after 1857, the lucknavi musical tradition came to influence the music of the renaissance in bengal, giving rise to the tradition of ragpradhan gan around the turn of the century. raja chakradhar singh of raigarh was the last of the modern era maharajas to patronize hindustani classical musicians, singers and dancers.[4][5]\\n\\nalso, at the turn of the century, vishnu digambar paluskar and vishnu narayan bhatkhande spread hindustani classical music to the masses in general by organizing music conferences, starting schools, teaching music in classrooms, devising a standardized grading and testing system, and standardizing the notation system.[6]\\n\\nvishnu digambar paluskar emerged as a talented musician and organizer despite having been blinded at age 12. his books on music, as well as the gandharva mahavidyalaya music school that he opened in lahore in 1901, helped foster a movement away from the closed gharana system.\\n\\npaluskar\\'s contemporary (and occasional rival) vishnu narayan bhatkhande recognized the many rifts that had appeared in the structure of indian classical music. he undertook extensive research visits to a large number of gharanas, hindustani as well as carnatic, collecting and comparing compositions. between 1909 and 1932, he produced the monumental four-volume work hindustani sangeetha paddhati,[7] which suggested a transcription for indian music, and described the many traditions in this notation. finally, it suggested a possible categorization of ragas based on their notes into a number of thaats (modes), subsequent to the melakarta system that reorganized carnatic tradition in the 17th century. the ragas that exist today were categorized according to this scheme, although there are some inconsistencies and ambiguities in bhatkande\\'s system.\\n\\nin modern times, the government-run all india radio, bangladesh betar and radio pakistan helped to bring the artists to public attention, countering the loss of the patronage system. the first star was gauhar jan, whose career was born out of fred gaisberg\\'s first recordings of indian music in 1902. with the advance of films and other public media, musicians started to make their living through public performances. a number of gurukuls, such as that of alauddin khan at maihar, flourished. in more modern times, corporate support has also been forthcoming, as at the itc sangeet research academy. meanwhile, hindustani classical music has become popular across the world through the influence of artists such as ravi shankar and ali akbar khan.\\n\\nprinciples of hindustani music\\nthe gandharva veda is a sanskrit scripture describing the theory of music and its applications in not just musical form and systems but also in physics, medicine and magic.[8] it is said that there are two types of sound: āhata (struck/audible) and anāhata (unstruck/inaudible).[8] the inaudible sound is said to be the principle of all manifestation, the basis of all substance.[8]\\n\\nthere are three main octaves: low (mandra), medium (madhya) and high (tāra).[8] each octave resonates with a certain part of the body, low octave in the heart, medium octave in the throat and high octave in the head.[8]\\n\\nthe rhythmic organization is based on rhythmic patterns called tala. the melodic foundations are called ragas. one possible classification of ragas is into \"melodic modes\" or \"parent scales\", known as thaats, under which most ragas can be classified based on the notes they use.\\n\\nthaats may consist of up to seven scale degrees, or swara. hindustani musicians name these pitches using a system called sargam, the equivalent of the western movable do solfege:\\n\\nsa (ṣaḍja षड्ज) = do\\nre (rishabh ऋषभ) = re\\nga (gāndhāra गान्धार) = mi\\nma (madhyama (music) मध्यम) = fa\\npa (pancham पञ्चम) = so\\ndha (dhaivat धैवत) = la\\nni (nishād निषाद) = ti\\nsa (ṣaḍja षड्ज) = do\\nboth systems repeat at the octave. the difference between sargam and solfege is that re, ga, ma, dha, and ni can refer to either \"natural\" (shuddha) or altered \"flat\" (komal) or \"sharp\" (teevra) versions of their respective scale degrees. as with movable do solfege, the notes are heard relative to an arbitrary tonic that varies from performance to performance, rather than to fixed frequencies, as on a xylophone. the fine intonational differences between different instances of the same swara are called srutis. the three primary registers of indian classical music are mandra (lower), madhya (middle) and taar (upper). since the octave location is not fixed, it is also possible to use provenances in mid-register (such as mandra-madhya or madhya-taar) for certain ragas. a typical rendition of hindustani raga involves two stages:\\n\\nalap: a rhythmically free improvisation on the rules for the raga in order to give life to the raga and flesh out its characteristics. the alap is followed by a long slow-tempo improvisation in vocal music, or by the jod and jhala in instrumental music.\\ntans are of several types like shuddha, koot, mishra, vakra, sapaat, saral, chhoot, halaq, jabda, murki\\n\\nbandish or gat: a fixed, melodic composition set in a specific raga, performed with rhythmic accompaniment by a tabla or pakhavaj. there are different ways of systematizing the parts of a composition. for example:\\nsthaayi: the initial, rondo phrase or line of a fixed, melodic composition\\nantara: the first body phrase or line of a fixed, melodic composition\\nsanchaari: the third body phrase or line of a fixed, melodic composition, seen more typically in dhrupad bandishes\\naabhog: the fourth and concluding body phrase or line of a fixed, melodic composition, seen more typically in dhrupad bandishes\\nthere are three variations of bandish, regarding tempo:\\nvilambit bandish: a slow and steady melodic composition, usually in largo to adagio speeds\\nmadhyalaya bandish: a medium tempo melodic composition, usually set in andante to allegretto speeds\\ndrut bandish: a fast tempo melodic composition, usually set to allegretto speed or faster\\nhindustani classical music is primarily vocal-centric, insofar as the musical forms were designed primarily for a vocal performance, and many instruments were designed and evaluated as to how well they emulate the human voice.\\n\\ntypes of compositions\\nthe major vocal forms or styles associated with hindustani classical music are dhrupad, khyal, and tarana. light classical forms include dhamar, trivat, chaiti, kajari, tappa, tap-khyal, ashtapadis, thumri, dadra, ghazal and bhajan; these do not adhere to the rigorous rules of classical music.[clarification needed]\\n\\ndhrupad\\nmain article: dhrupad\\ndhrupad is an old style of singing, traditionally performed by male singers. it is performed with a tambura and a pakhawaj as instrumental accompaniments. the lyrics, some of which were written in sanskrit centuries ago, are presently often sung in brajbhasha, a medieval form of north and east indian languages that were spoken in eastern india. the rudra veena, an ancient string instrument, is used in instrumental music in dhrupad.\\n\\ndhrupad music is primarily devotional in theme and content. it contains recitals in praise of particular deities. dhrupad compositions begin with a relatively long and acyclic alap, where the syllables of the following mantra is recited:\\n\\n\"om anant tam taran tarini twam hari om narayan, anant hari om narayan\".\\n\\nthe alap gradually unfolds into more rhythmic jod and jhala sections. these sections are followed by a rendition of bandish, with the pakhawaj as an accompaniment. the great indian musician tansen sang in the dhrupad style. a lighter form of dhrupad called dhamar, is sung primarily during the spring festival of holi.\\n\\ndhrupad was the main form of northern indian classical music until two centuries ago when it gave way to the somewhat less austere khyal, a more free-form style of singing. since losing its main patrons among the royalty in indian princely states, dhrupad risked becoming extinct in the first half of the twentieth century. however, the efforts by a few proponents, especially from the dagar family, have led to its revival.\\n\\nsome of the best known vocalists who sing in the dhrupad style are the members of the dagar lineage, including the senior dagar brothers, nasir moinuddin and nasir aminuddin dagar; the junior dagar brothers, nasir zahiruddin and nasir faiyazuddin dagar; and wasifuddin, fariduddin, and sayeeduddin dagar. other leading exponents include the gundecha brothers and uday bhawalkar, who have received training from some of the dagars. leading vocalists outside the dagar lineage include the mallik family of darbhanga tradition of musicians; some of the leading exponents of this tradition were ram chatur mallick, siyaram tiwari, and vidur mallick. at present prem kumar mallick, prashant and nishant mallick are the dhrupad vocalists of this tradition.\\n\\na section of dhrupad singers of delhi gharana from mughal emperor shah jahan\\'s court migrated to bettiah under the patronage of the bettiah raj, giving rise to the bettiah gharana.[9]\\n\\nkhyal\\nmain article: khyal\\nkhyal is the modern hindustani form of vocal music. khyal, literally meaning \"thought\" or \"imagination\" in hindustani and derived from the persian/arabic term, is a two- to eight-line lyric set to a melody. khyal contains a greater variety of embellishments and ornamentations compared to dhrupad. khyal\\'s features such as sargam and taan as well as movements to incorporate dhrupad-style alap have led to it becoming popular.\\n\\nthe importance of the khyal\\'s content is for the singer to depict, through music in the set raga, the emotional significance of the khyal. the singer improvises and finds inspiration within the raga to depict the khyal.\\n\\nthe origin of khyal is controversial, although it is accepted that this style was based on dhrupad and influenced by other musical traditions. many argue that amir khusrau created the style in the late 14th century. this form was popularized by mughal emperor mohammad shah through his court musicians; some well-known composers of this period were sadarang, adarang, and manrang.\\n\\ntarana\\nmain article: tarana\\nanother vocal form, taranas are medium- to fast-paced songs that are used to convey a mood of elation and are usually performed towards the end of a concert. they consist of a few lines of farsi poetry with soft syllables or bols set to a tune. the singer uses these few lines as a basis for fast improvisation. the tillana of carnatic music is based on the tarana, although the former is primarily associated with dance.\\n\\ntappa\\nmain article: tappa\\ntappa is a form of indian semi-classical vocal music whose specialty is its rolling pace based on fast, subtle, knotty construction. it originated from the folk songs of the camel riders of punjab and was developed as a form of classical music by mian ghulam nabi shori or shori mian, a court singer for asaf-ud-dowlah, the nawab of awadh. \"nidhubabur tappa\", or tappas sung by nidhu babu were very popular in 18th and 19th-century bengal.\\n\\nthumri\\nmain article: thumri\\nthumri is a semi-classical vocal form said to have begun in uttar pradesh with the court of nawab wajid ali shah, (r. 1847–1856). there are three types of thumri: poorab ang, lucknavi, and punjabi thumri. the lyrics are typically in a proto-hindi language called brij bhasha and are usually romantic.\\n\\nabdul karim khan performing a thumri in raag bhairavi.\\nsome recent performers of this genre are abdul karim khan, the brothers barkat ali khan and bade ghulam ali khan, begum akhtar, girija devi, prabha atre, siddheshwari devi, and shobha gurtu.\\n\\nghazal\\nmain article: ghazal\\nin the indian sub-continent, ghazal became the most common form of poetry in the urdu language and was popularized by classical poets like mir taqi mir, ghalib, daagh, zauq and sauda amongst the north indian literary elite. vocal music set to this mode of poetry is popular with multiple variations across central asia, the middle east, as well as other countries and regions of the world.\\n\\ninstruments\\nalthough hindustani music clearly is focused on vocal performance, instrumental forms have existed since ancient times. in fact, in recent decades, especially outside south asia, instrumental hindustani music is more popular than vocal music, partly due to a somewhat different style and faster tempo, and partly because of a language barrier for the lyrics in vocal music.\\n\\na number of musical instruments are associated with hindustani classical music. the veena, a string instrument, was traditionally regarded as the most important, but few play it today and it has largely been superseded by its cousins the sitar and the sarod, both of which owe their origin to persian influences. among bowed instruments, the sarangi and violin are popular. the bansuri, shehnai and harmonium are important wind instruments. in the percussion ensemble, the tabla and the pakhavaj are the most popular. rarely used plucked or struck string instruments include the surbahar, sursringar, santoor, and various versions of the slide guitar. various other instruments have also been used in varying degrees.\\n\\nfestivals\\namong the earliest modern music festivals focusing on hindustani classical music was the harballabh sangeet sammelan, founded in 1875 in jallandhar. dover lane music conference notably debuted in 1952 in kolkata and sawai gandharva bhimsen festival in 1953 in pune, while festivals such as the itc sra sangeet sammelan appeared in the early 1970s.\\netymology and definitions\\nthe word psychology derives from greek roots meaning study of the psyche, or soul (ψυχή psychē, \"breath, spirit, soul\" and -λογία -logia, \"study of\" or \"research\").[8] the latin word psychologia was first used by the croatian humanist and latinist marko marulić in his book, psichiologia de ratione animae humanae in the late 15th century or early 16th century.[9] the earliest known reference to the word psychology in english was by steven blankaart in 1694 in the physical dictionary which refers to \"anatomy, which treats the body, and psychology, which treats of the soul.\"[10]\\n\\nin 1890, william james defined psychology as \"the science of mental life, both of its phenomena and their conditions\". this definition enjoyed widespread currency for decades. however, this meaning was contested, notably by radical behaviorists such as john b. watson, who in his 1913 manifesto defined the discipline of psychology as the acquisition of information useful to the control of behavior. also since james defined it, the term more strongly connotes techniques of scientific experimentation.[11][12] folk psychology refers to the understanding of ordinary people, as contrasted with that of psychology professionals.[13]\\n\\nhistory\\nmain article: history of psychology\\nthe ancient civilizations of egypt, greece, china, india, and persia all engaged in the philosophical study of psychology. in ancient egypt the ebers papyrus mentioned depression and thought disorders.[14] historians note that greek philosophers, including thales, plato, and aristotle (especially in his de anima treatise),[15] addressed the workings of the mind.[16] as early as the 4th century bc, greek physician hippocrates theorized that mental disorders had physical rather than supernatural causes.[17]\\n\\nin china, psychological understanding grew from the philosophical works of laozi and confucius, and later from the doctrines of buddhism. this body of knowledge involves insights drawn from introspection and observation, as well as techniques for focused thinking and acting. it frames the universe as a division of, and interaction between, physical reality and mental reality, with an emphasis on purifying the mind in order to increase virtue and power. an ancient text known as the yellow emperor\\'s classic of internal medicine identifies the brain as the nexus of wisdom and sensation, includes theories of personality based on yin–yang balance, and analyzes mental disorder in terms of physiological and social disequilibria. chinese scholarship focused on the brain advanced in the qing dynasty with the work of western-educated fang yizhi (1611–1671), liu zhi (1660–1730), and wang qingren (1768–1831). wang qingren emphasized the importance of the brain as the center of the nervous system, linked mental disorder with brain diseases, investigated the causes of dreams and insomnia, and advanced a theory of hemispheric lateralization in brain function.[18]\\n\\ndistinctions in types of awareness appear in the ancient thought of india, influenced by hinduism. a central idea of the upanishads is the distinction between a person\\'s transient mundane self and their eternal unchanging soul. divergent hindu doctrines, and buddhism, have challenged this hierarchy of selves, but have all emphasized the importance of reaching higher awareness. yoga is a range of techniques used in pursuit of this goal. much of the sanskrit corpus was suppressed under the british east india company followed by the british raj in the 1800s. however, indian doctrines influenced western thinking via the theosophical society, a new age group which became popular among euro-american intellectuals.[19]\\n\\npsychology was a popular topic in enlightenment europe. in germany, gottfried wilhelm leibniz (1646–1716) applied his principles of calculus to the mind, arguing that mental activity took place on an indivisible continuum—most notably, that among an infinity of human perceptions and desires, the difference between conscious and unconscious awareness is only a matter of degree. christian wolff identified psychology as its own science, writing psychologia empirica in 1732 and psychologia rationalis in 1734. this notion advanced further under immanuel kant, who established the idea of anthropology, with psychology as an important subdivision. however, kant explicitly and notoriously rejected the idea of experimental psychology, writing that \"the empirical doctrine of the soul can also never approach chemistry even as a systematic art of analysis or experimental doctrine, for in it the manifold of inner observation can be separated only by mere division in thought, and cannot then be held separate and recombined at will (but still less does another thinking subject suffer himself to be experimented upon to suit our purpose), and even observation by itself already changes and displaces the state of the observed object.\" in 1783, ferdinand ueberwasser (1752-1812) designated himself professor of empirical psychology and logic and gave lectures on scientific psychology, though these developments were soon overshadowed by the napoleonic wars, after which the old university of münster was discontinued by prussian authorities.[20] having consulted philosophers hegel and herbart, however, in 1825 the prussian state established psychology as a mandatory discipline in its rapidly expanding and highly influential educational system. however, this discipline did not yet embrace experimentation.[21] in england, early psychology involved phrenology and the response to social problems including alcoholism, violence, and the country\\'s well-populated mental asylums.[22]\\n\\nbeginning of experimental psychology\\n\\nwilhelm wundt (seated) with colleagues in his psychological laboratory, the first of its kind.\\ngustav fechner began conducting psychophysics research in leipzig in the 1830s, articulating the principle (weber–fechner law) that human perception of a stimulus varies logarithmically according to its intensity.[23] fechner\\'s 1860 elements of psychophysics challenged kant\\'s stricture against quantitative study of the mind.[24][21] in heidelberg, hermann von helmholtz conducted parallel research on sensory perception, and trained physiologist wilhelm wundt. wundt, in turn, came to leipzig university, establishing the psychological laboratory which brought experimental psychology to the world. wundt focused on breaking down mental processes into the most basic components, motivated in part by an analogy to recent advances in chemistry, and its successful investigation of the elements and structure of material.[25] paul flechsig and emil kraepelin soon created another influential psychology laboratory at leipzig, this one focused on more on experimental psychiatry.[21]\\n\\npsychologists in germany, denmark, austria, england, and the united states soon followed wundt in setting up laboratories.[26] g. stanley hall who studied with wundt, formed a psychology lab at johns hopkins university in maryland, which became internationally influential. hall, in turn, trained yujiro motora, who brought experimental psychology, emphasizing psychophysics, to the imperial university of tokyo.[27] wundt\\'s assistant, hugo münsterberg, taught psychology at harvard to students such as narendra nath sen gupta—who, in 1905, founded a psychology department and laboratory at the university of calcutta.[19] wundt students walter dill scott, lightner witmer, and james mckeen cattell worked on developing tests for mental ability. catell, who also studied with eugenicist francis galton, went on to found the psychological corporation. wittmer focused on mental testing of children; scott, on selection of employees.[28]\\n\\nanother student of wundt, edward titchener, created the psychology program at cornell university and advanced a doctrine of \"structuralist\" psychology. structuralism sought to analyze and classify different aspects of the mind, primarily through the method of introspection.[29] william james, john dewey and harvey carr advanced a more expansive doctrine called functionalism, attuned more to human–environment actions. in 1890, james wrote an influential book, the principles of psychology, which expanded on the realm of structuralism, memorably described the human \"stream of consciousness\", and interested many american students in the emerging discipline.[29][30][31] dewey integrated psychology with social issues, most notably by promoting the cause progressive education to assimilate immigrants and inculcate moral values in children.[32]\\n\\n\\none of the dogs used in pavlov\\'s experiment with a surgically implanted cannula to measure salivation, preserved in the pavlov museum in ryazan, russia\\na different strain of experimentalism, with more connection to physiology, emerged in south america, under the leadership of horacio g. piñero at the university of buenos aires.[33] russia, too, placed greater emphasis on the biological basis for psychology, beginning with ivan sechenov\\'s 1873 essay, \"who is to develop psychology and how?\" sechenov advanced the idea of brain reflexes and aggressively promoted a deterministic viewpoint on human behavior.[34]\\n\\nwolfgang kohler, max wertheimer and kurt koffka co-founded the school of gestalt psychology (not to be confused with the gestalt therapy of fritz perls). this approach is based upon the idea that individuals experience things as unified wholes. rather than breaking down thoughts and behavior into smaller elements, as in structuralism, the gestaltists maintained that whole of experience is important, and differs from the sum of its parts. other 19th-century contributors to the field include the german psychologist hermann ebbinghaus, a pioneer in the experimental study of memory, who developed quantitative models of learning and forgetting at the university of berlin,[35] and the russian-soviet physiologist ivan pavlov, who discovered in dogs a learning process that was later termed \"classical conditioning\" and applied to human beings.[36]\\n\\nconsolidation and funding\\none of the earliest psychology societies was la société de psychologie physiologique in france, which lasted 1885–1893. the first meeting of the international congress of psychology sponsored by the international union of psychological science took place in paris, in august 1889, amidst the world\\'s fair celebrating the centennial of the french revolution. william james was one of three americans among the four hundred attendees. the american psychological association (apa) was founded soon after, in 1892. the international congress continued to be held, at different locations in europe, with wider international participation. the sixth congress, geneva 1909, included presentations in russian, chinese, and japanese, as well as esperanto. after a hiatus for world war i, the seventh congress met in oxford, with substantially greater participation from the war-victorious anglo-americans. in 1929, the congress took place at yale university in new haven, connecticut, attended by hundreds of members of the apa.[26] tokyo imperial university led the way in bringing new psychology to the east, and from japan these ideas diffused into china.[18][27]\\n\\namerican psychology gained status during world war i, during which a standing committee headed by robert yerkes administered mental tests (\"army alpha\" and \"army beta\") to almost 1.8 million soldiers.[37] subsequent funding for behavioral research came in large part from the rockefeller family, via the social science research council.[38][39] rockefeller charities funded the national committee on mental hygiene, which promoted the concept of mental illness and lobbied for psychological supervision of child development.[37][40] through the bureau of social hygiene and later funding of alfred kinsey, rockefeller foundations established sex research as a viable discipline in the u.s.[41] under the influence of the carnegie-funded eugenics record office, the draper-funded pioneer fund, and other institutions, the eugenics movement also had a significant impact on american psychology; in the 1910s and 1920s, eugenics became a standard topic in psychology classes.[42]\\n\\nduring world war ii and the cold war, the u.s. military and intelligence agencies established themselves as leading funders of psychology—through the armed forces and in the new office of strategic services intelligence agency. university of michigan psychologist dorwin cartwright reported that university researchers began large-scale propaganda research in 1939–1941, and \"the last few months of the war saw a social psychologist become chiefly responsible for determining the week-by-week-propaganda policy for the united states government.\" cartwright also wrote that psychologists had significant roles in managing the domestic economy.[43] the army rolled out its new general classification test and engaged in massive studies of troop morale. in the 1950s, the rockefeller foundation and ford foundation collaborated with the central intelligence agency (cia) to fund research on psychological warfare.[44] in 1965, public controversy called attention to the army\\'s project camelot—the \"manhattan project\" of social science—an effort which enlisted psychologists and anthropologists to analyze foreign countries for strategic purposes.[45][46]\\n\\nin germany after world war i, psychology held institutional power through the military, and subsequently expanded along with the rest of the military under the third reich.[21] under the direction of hermann göring\\'s cousin matthias göring, the berlin psychoanalytic institute was renamed the göring institute. freudian psychoanalysts were expelled and persecuted under the anti-jewish policies of the nazi party, and all psychologists had to distance themselves from freud and adler.[47] the göring institute was well-financed throughout the war with a mandate to create a \"new german psychotherapy\". this psychotherapy aimed to align suitable germans with the overall goals of the reich; as described by one physician: \"despite the importance of analysis, spiritual guidance and the active cooperation of the patient represent the best way to overcome individual mental problems and to subordinate them to the requirements of the volk and the gemeinschaft.\" psychologists were to provide seelenführung, leadership of the mind, to integrate people into the new vision of a german community.[48] harald schultz-hencke melded psychology with the nazi theory of biology and racial origins, criticizing psychoanalysis as a study of the weak and deformed.[49] johannes heinrich schultz, a german psychologist recognized for developing the technique of autogenic training, prominently advocated sterilization and euthanasia of men considered genetically undesirable, and devised techniques for facilitating this process.[50] after the war, some new institutions were created and some psychologists were discredited due to nazi affiliation. alexander mitscherlich founded a prominent applied psychoanalysis journal called psyche and with funding from the rockefeller foundation established the first clinical psychosomatic medicine division at heidelberg university. in 1970, psychology was integrated into the required studies of medical students.[51]\\n\\nafter the russian revolution, psychology was heavily promoted by the bolsheviks as a way to engineer the \"new man\" of socialism. thus, university psychology departments trained large numbers of students, for whom positions were made available at schools, workplaces, cultural institutions, and in the military. an especial focus was pedology, the study of child development, regarding which lev vygotsky became a prominent writer.[34] the bolsheviks also promoted free love and embraced the doctrine of psychoanalysis as an antidote to sexual repression.[52] although pedology and intelligence testing fell out of favor in 1936, psychology maintained its privileged position as an instrument of the soviet union.[34] stalinist purges took a heavy toll and instilled a climate of fear in the profession, as elsewhere in soviet society.[53] following world war ii, jewish psychologists past and present (including lev vygotsky, a.r. luria, and aron zalkind) were denounced; ivan pavlov (posthumously) and stalin himself were aggrandized as heroes of soviet psychology.[54] soviet academics was speedily liberalized during the khrushchev thaw, and cybernetics, linguistics, genetics, and other topics became acceptable again. there emerged a new field called \"engineering psychology\" which studied mental aspects of complex jobs (such as pilot and cosmonaut). interdisciplinary studies became popular and scholars such as georgy shchedrovitsky developed systems theory approaches to human behavior.[55]\\n\\ntwentieth-century chinese psychology originally modeled the u.s., with translations from american authors like william james, the establishment of university psychology departments and journals, and the establishment of groups including the chinese association of psychological testing (1930) and the chinese psychological society (1937). chinese psychologists were encouraged to focus on education and language learning, with the aspiration that education would enable modernization and nationalization. john dewey, who lectured to chinese audiences in 1918–1920, had a significant influence on this doctrine. chancellor t\\'sai yuan-p\\'ei introduced him at peking university as a greater thinker than confucius. kuo zing-yang who received a phd at the university of california, berkeley, became president of zhejiang university and popularized behaviorism.[56] after the chinese communist party gained control of the country, the stalinist soviet union became the leading influence, with marxism–leninism the leading social doctrine and pavlovian conditioning the approved concept of behavior change. chinese psychologists elaborated on lenin\\'s model of a \"reflective\" consciousness, envisioning an \"active consciousness\" (pinyin: tzu-chueh neng-tung-li) able to transcend material conditions through hard work and ideological struggle. they developed a concept of \"recognition\" (pinyin: jen-shih) which referred the interface between individual perceptions and the socially accepted worldview (failure to correspond with party doctrine was \"incorrect recognition\").[57] psychology education was centralized under the chinese academy of sciences, supervised by the state council. in 1951, the academy created a psychology research office, which in 1956 became the institute of psychology. most leading psychologists were educated in the united states, and the first concern of the academy was re-education of these psychologists in the soviet doctrines. child psychology and pedagogy for nationally cohesive education remained a central goal of the discipline.[58]\\n\\ndisciplinary organization\\ninstitutions\\nsee also: list of psychology organizations\\nin 1920, édouard claparède and pierre bovet created a new applied psychology organization called the international congress of psychotechnics applied to vocational guidance, later called the international congress of psychotechnics and then the international association of applied psychology.[26] the iaap is considered the oldest international psychology association.[59] today, at least 65 international groups deal with specialized aspects of psychology.[59] in response to male predominance in the field, female psychologists in the u.s. formed national council of women psychologists in 1941. this organization became the international council of women psychologists after world war ii, and the international council of psychologists in 1959. several associations including the association of black psychologists and the asian american psychological association have arisen to promote non-european racial groups in the profession.[59]\\n\\nthe world federation of national psychological societies is the international union of psychological science (iupsys), founded in 1951 under the auspices of unesco, the united nations cultural and scientific authority.[26][60] psychology departments have since proliferated around the world, based primarily on the euro-american model.[19][60] since 1966, the union has published the international journal of psychology.[26] iaap and iupsys agreed in 1976 each to hold a congress every four years, on a staggered basis.[59]\\n\\nthe international union recognizes 66 national psychology associations and at least 15 others exist.[59] the american psychological association is the oldest and largest.[59] its membership has increased from 5,000 in 1945 to 100,000 in the present day.[29] the apa includes 54 divisions, which since 1960 have steadily proliferated to include more specialties. some of these divisions, such as the society for the psychological study of social issues and the american psychology–law society, began as autonomous groups.[59]\\n\\nthe interamerican society of psychology, founded in 1951, aspires to promote psychology and coordinate psychologists across the western hemisphere. it holds the interamerican congress of psychology and had 1,000 members in year 2000. the european federation of professional psychology associations, founded in 1981, represents 30 national associations with a total of 100,000 individual members. at least 30 other international groups organize psychologists in different regions.[59]\\n\\nin some places, governments legally regulate who can provide psychological services or represent themselves as a \"psychologist\".[61] the apa defines a psychologist as someone with a doctoral degree in psychology.[62]\\n\\nboundaries\\nearly practitioners of experimental psychology distinguished themselves from parapsychology, which in the late nineteenth century enjoyed great popularity (including the interest of scholars such as william james), and indeed constituted the bulk of what people called \"psychology\". parapsychology, hypnotism, and psychism were major topics of the early international congresses. but students of these fields were eventually ostractized, and more or less banished from the congress in 1900–1905.[26] parapsychology persisted for a time at imperial university, with publications such as clairvoyance and thoughtography by tomokichi fukurai, but here too it was mostly shunned by 1913.[27]\\n\\nas a discipline, psychology has long sought to fend off accusations that it is a \"soft\" science. philosopher of science thomas kuhn\\'s 1962 critique implied psychology overall was in a pre-paradigm state, lacking the agreement on overarching theory found in mature sciences such as chemistry and physics.[63] because some areas of psychology rely on research methods such as surveys and questionnaires, critics asserted that psychology is not an objective science. skeptics have suggested that personality, thinking, and emotion, cannot be directly measured and are often inferred from subjective self-reports, which may be problematic. experimental psychologists have devised a variety of ways to indirectly measure these elusive phenomenological entities.[64][65][66]\\n\\ndivisions still exist within the field, with some psychologists more oriented towards the unique experiences of individual humans, which cannot be understood only as data points within a larger population. critics inside and outside the field have argued that mainstream psychology has become increasingly dominated by a \"cult of empiricism\" which limits the scope of its study by using only methods derived from the physical sciences.[67] feminist critiques along these lines have argued that claims to scientific objectivity obscure the values and agenda of (historically mostly male)[37] researchers. jean grimshaw, for example, argues that mainstream psychological research has advanced a patriarchal agenda through its efforts to control behavior.[68]\\n\\nmajor schools of thought\\nbiological\\n\\nfalse-color representations of cerebral fiber pathways affected, per van horn et al.[v]:3\\npsychologists generally consider the organism the basis of the mind, and therefore a vitally related area of study. psychiatrists and neuropsychologists work at the interface of mind and body.[69] biological psychology, also known as physiological psychology,[70] or neuropsychology is the study of the biological substrates of behavior and mental processes. key research topics in this field include comparative psychology, which studies humans in relation to other animals, and perception which involves the physical mechanics of sensation as well as neural and mental processing.[71] for centuries, a leading question in biological psychology has been whether and how mental functions might be localized in the brain. from phineas gage to h.m. and clive wearing, individual people with mental issues traceable to physical damage have inspired new discoveries in this area.[70] modern neuropsychology could be said to originate in the 1870s, when in france paul broca traced production of speech to the left frontal gyrus, thereby also demonstrating hemispheric lateralization of brain function. soon after, carl wernicke identified a related area necessary for the understanding of speech.[72]\\n\\nthe contemporary field of behavioral neuroscience focuses on physical causes underpinning behavior. for example, physiological psychologists use animal models, typically rats, to study the neural, genetic, and cellular mechanisms that underlie specific behaviors such as learning and memory and fear responses.[73] cognitive neuroscientists investigate the neural correlates of psychological processes in humans using neural imaging tools, and neuropsychologists conduct psychological assessments to determine, for instance, specific aspects and extent of cognitive deficit caused by brain damage or disease. the biopsychosocial model is an integrated perspective toward understanding consciousness, behavior, and social interaction. it assumes that any given behavior or mental process affects and is affected by dynamically interrelated biological, psychological, and social factors.[74]\\n\\nevolutionary psychology examines cognition and personality traits from an evolutionary perspective. this perspective suggests that psychological adaptations evolved to solve recurrent problems in human ancestral environments. evolutionary psychology offers complementary explanations for the mostly proximate or developmental explanations developed by other areas of psychology: that is, it focuses mostly on ultimate or \"why?\" questions, rather than proximate or \"how?\" questions. \"how?\" questions are more directly tackled by behavioral genetics research, which aims to understand how genes and environment impact behavior.[75]\\n\\nthe search for biological origins of psychological phenomena has long involved debates about the importance of race, and especially the relationship between race and intelligence. the idea of white supremacy and indeed the modern concept of race itself arose during the process of world conquest by europeans.[76] carl von linnaeus\\'s four-fold classification of humans classifies europeans as intelligent and severe, americans as contented and free, asians as ritualistic, and africans as lazy and capricious. race was also used to justify the construction of socially specific mental disorders such as drapetomania and dysaesthesia aethiopica—the behavior of uncooperative african slaves.[77] after the creation of experimental psychology, \"ethnical psychology\" emerged as a subdiscipline, based on the assumption that studying primitive races would provide an important link between animal behavior and the psychology of more evolved humans.[78]\\n\\nbehavioral\\nmain articles: behaviorism, psychological behaviorism, and radical behaviorism\\n\\nskinner\\'s teaching

mammals, based on the idea that humans exhibit similar fundamental tendencies. behavioral research ever aspires to improve the effectiveness of techniques for behavior modification.\\n\\nfile:little albert experiment (1920).webm\\nthe film of the little albert experiment\\nearly behavioral researchers studied stimulus–response pairings, now known as classical conditioning. they demonstrated that behaviors could be linked through repeated association with stimuli eliciting pain or pleasure. ivan pavlov—known best for inducing dogs to salivate in the presence of a stimulus previously linked with food—became a leading figure in the soviet union and inspired followers to use his methods on humans.[34] in the united states, edward lee thorndike initiated \"connectionism\" studies by trapping animals in \"puzzle boxes\" and rewarding them for escaping. thorndike wrote in 1911: \"there can be no moral warrant for studying man\\'s nature unless the study will enable us to control his acts.\"[79] from 1910–1913 the american psychological association went through a sea change of opinion, away from mentalism and towards \"behavioralism\", and in 1913 john b. watson coined the term behaviorism for this school of thought.[80] watson\\'s famous little albert experiment in 1920 demonstrated that repeated use of upsetting loud noises could instill phobias (aversions to other stimuli) in an infant human.[12][81] karl lashley, a close collaborator with watson, examined biological manifestations of learning in the brain.[70]\\n\\nembraced and extended by clark l. hull, edwin guthrie, and others, behaviorism became a widely used research paradigm.[29] a new method of \"instrumental\" or \"operant\" conditioning added the concepts of reinforcement and punishment to the model of behavior change. radical behaviorists avoided discussing the inner workings of the mind, especially the unconscious mind, which they considered impossible to assess scientifically.[82] operant conditioning was first described by miller and kanorski and popularized in the u.s. by b.f. skinner, who emerged as a leading intellectual of the behaviorist movement.[83][84]\\n\\nnoam chomsky delivered an influential critique of radical behaviorism on the grounds that it could not adequately explain the complex mental process of language acquisition.[85][86][87] martin seligman and colleagues discovered that the conditioning of dogs led to outcomes (\"learned helplessness\") that opposed the predictions of behaviorism.[88][89] skinner\\'s behaviorism did not die, perhaps in part because it generated successful practical applications.[85] edward c. tolman advanced a hybrid \"cognitive behaviorial\" model, most notably with his 1948 publication discussing the cognitive maps used by rats to guess at the location of food at the end of a modified maze.[90]\\n\\nthe association for behavior analysis international was founded in 1974 and by 2003 had members from 42 countries. the field has been especially influential in latin america, where it has a regional organization known as alamoc: la asociación latinoamericana de análisis y modificación del comportamiento. behaviorism also gained a strong foothold in japan, where it gave rise to the japanese society of animal psychology (1933), the japanese association of special education (1963), the japanese society of biofeedback research (1973), the japanese association for behavior therapy (1976), the japanese association for behavior analysis (1979), and the japanese association for behavioral science research (1994).[91] today the field of behaviorism is also commonly referred to as behavior modification or behavior analysis.[91]\\n\\ncognitive\\nmain article: cognitive psychology\\ngreen red

informed by functionalism and experimental psychology.\\n\\n\\nbaddeley\\'s model of working memory\\nstarting in the 1950s, the experimental techniques developed by wundt, james, ebbinghaus, and others re-emerged as experimental psychology became increasingly cognitivist—concerned with information and its processing—and, eventually, constituted a part of the wider cognitive science.[92] some called this development the cognitive revolution because it rejected the anti-mentalist dogma of behaviorism as well as the strictures of psychoanalysis.[92]\\n\\nsocial learning theorists, such as

about mental processes from shared phenomena such as optical illusions.\\ntechnological advances also renewed interest in mental states and representations. english neuroscientist charles sherrington and canadian psychologist donald o. hebb used experimental methods to link psychological phenomena with the structure and function of the brain. the rise of computer science, cybernetics and artificial intelligence suggested the value of comparatively studying information processing in humans and machines. research in cognition had proven practical since world war ii, when it aided in the understanding of weapons operation.[94]\\n\\na popular and representative topic in this area is cognitive bias, or irrational thought. psychologists (and economists) have classified and described a sizeable catalogue of biases which recur frequently in human thought. the availability heuristic, for example, is the tendency to overestimate the importance of something which happens to come readily to mind.[95]\\n\\nelements of behaviorism and cognitive psychology were synthesized to form cognitive behavioral therapy, a form of psychotherapy modified from techniques developed by american psychologist albert ellis and american psychiatrist aaron t. beck.\\n\\non a broader level, cognitive science is an interdisciplinary enterprise of cognitive psychologists, cognitive neuroscientists, researchers in artificial intelligence, linguists, human–computer interaction, computational neuroscience, logicians and social scientists. the discipline of cognitive science covers cognitive psychology as well as philosophy of mind, computer science, and neuroscience.[citation needed] computer simulations are sometimes used to model phenomena of interest.\\n\\nsocial\\nmain article: social psychology\\nsee also: social psychology (sociology)\\n\\nsocial psychology studies the nature and causes of social behavior.\\nsocial psychology is the study of how humans think about each other and how they relate to each other. social psychologists study such topics as the influence of others on an individual\\'s behavior (e.g. conformity, persuasion), and the formation of beliefs, attitudes, and stereotypes about other people. social cognition fuses elements of social and cognitive psychology in order to understand how people process, remember, or distort social information. the study of group dynamics reveals information about the nature and potential optimization of leadership, communication, and other phenomena that emerge at least at the microsocial level. in recent years, many social psychologists have become increasingly interested in implicit measures, mediational models, and the interaction of both person and social variables in accounting for behavior. the study of human society is therefore a potentially valuable source of information about the causes of psychiatric disorder. some sociological concepts applied to psychiatric disorders are the social role, sick role, social class, life event, culture, migration, social, and total institution.[96]\\n\\npsychoanalysis\\nmain articles: psychodynamics and psychoanalysis\\n\\ngroup photo 1909 in front of clark university. front row: sigmund freud, g. stanley hall, carl jung; back row: abraham a. brill, ernest jones, sándor ferenczi.\\npsychoanalysis comprises a method of investigating the mind and interpreting experience; a systematized set of theories about human behavior; and a form of psychotherapy to treat psychological or emotional distress, especially conflict originating in the unconscious mind.[97] this school of thought originated in the 1890s with austrian medical doctors including josef breuer (physician), alfred adler (physician), otto rank (psychoanalyst), and most prominently sigmund freud (neurologist). freud\\'s psychoanalytic theory was largely based on interpretive methods, introspection and clinical observations. it became very well known, largely because it tackled subjects such as sexuality, repression, and the unconscious. these subjects were largely taboo at the time, and freud provided a catalyst for their open discussion in polite society.[52] clinically, freud helped to pioneer the method of free association and a therapeutic interest in dream interpretation.[98][99]\\n\\nswiss psychiatrist carl jung, influenced by freud, elaborated a theory of the collective unconscious—a primordial force present in all humans, featuring archetypes which exerted a profound influence on the mind. jung\\'s competing vision formed the basis for analytical psychology, which later led to the archetypal and process-oriented schools. other well-known psychoanalytic scholars of the mid-20th century include erik erikson, melanie klein, d.w. winnicott, karen horney, erich fromm, john bowlby, and sigmund freud\\'s daughter, anna freud. throughout the 20th century, psychoanalysis evolved into diverse schools of thought which could be called neo-freudian. among these schools are ego psychology, object relations, and interpersonal, lacanian, and relational psychoanalysis.[citation needed]\\n\\npsychologists such as hans eysenck and philosophers including karl popper criticized psychoanalysis. popper argued that psychoanalysis had been misrepresented as a scientific discipline,[100] whereas eysenck said that psychoanalytic tenets had been contradicted by experimental data. by the end of 20th century, psychology departments in american universities mostly marginalized freudian theory, dismissing it as a \"desiccated and dead\" historical artifact.[101] however, researchers in the emerging field of neuro-psychoanalysis today defend some of freud\\'s ideas on scientific grounds,[102] while scholars of the humanities maintain that freud was not a \"scientist at all, but ... an interpreter\".[101]\\n\\nexistential-humanistic theories\\nmain articles: existential psychology and humanistic psychology\\n\\npsychologist abraham maslow in 1943 posited that humans have a hierarchy of needs, and it makes sense to fulfill the basic needs first (food, water etc.) before higher-order needs can be met.[103]\\nhumanistic psychology developed in the 1950s as a movement within academic psychology, in reaction to both behaviorism and psychoanalysis.[104] the humanistic approach sought to glimpse the whole person, not just fragmented parts of the personality or isolated cognitions.[105] humanism focused on uniquely human issues, such as free will, personal growth, self-actualization, self-identity, death, aloneness, freedom, and meaning. it emphasized subjective meaning, rejection of determinism, and concern for positive growth rather than pathology.[citation needed] some founders of the humanistic school of thought were american psychologists abraham maslow, who formulated a hierarchy of human needs, and carl rogers, who created and developed client-centered therapy. later, positive psychology opened up humanistic themes to scientific modes of exploration.\\n\\nthe american association for humanistic psychology, formed in 1963, declared:\\n\\nhumanistic psychology is primarily an orientation toward the whole of psychology rather than a distinct area or school. it stands for respect for the worth of persons, respect for differences of approach, open-mindedness as to acceptable methods, and interest in exploration of new aspects of human behavior. as a \"third force\" in contemporary psychology, it is concerned with topics having little place in existing theories and systems: e.g., love, creativity, self, growth, organism, basic need-gratification, self-actualization, higher values, being, becoming, spontaneity, play, humor, affection, naturalness, warmth, ego-transcendence, objectivity, autonomy, responsibility, meaning, fair-play, transcendental experience, peak experience, courage, and related concepts.[106]\\n\\nin the 1950s and 1960s, influenced by philosophers søren kierkegaard and martin heidegger and, psychoanalytically trained american psychologist rollo may pioneered an existential branch of psychology, which included existential psychotherapy: a method based on the belief that inner conflict within a person is due to that individual\\'s confrontation with the givens of existence. swiss psychoanalyst ludwig binswanger and american psychologist george kelly may also be said to belong to the existential school.[107] existential psychologists differed from more \"humanistic\" psychologists in their relatively neutral view of human nature and their relatively positive assessment of anxiety.[108] existential psychologists emphasized the humanistic themes of death, free will, and meaning, suggesting that meaning can be shaped by myths, or narrative patterns,[109] and that it can be encouraged by an acceptance of the free will requisite to an authentic, albeit often anxious, regard for death and other future prospects.\\n\\naustrian existential psychiatrist and holocaust survivor viktor frankl drew evidence of meaning\\'s therapeutic power from reflections garnered from his own internment.[110] he created a variation of existential psychotherapy called logotherapy, a type of existentialist analysis that focuses on a will to meaning (in one\\'s life), as opposed to adler\\'s nietzschean doctrine of will to power or freud\\'s will to pleasure.[111]\\n\\nthemes\\npersonality\\nmain article: personality psychology\\npersonality psychology is concerned with enduring patterns of behavior, thought, and emotion—commonly referred to as personality—in individuals. theories of personality vary across different psychological schools and orientations. they carry different assumptions about such issues as the role of the unconscious and the importance of childhood experience. according to freud, personality is based on the dynamic interactions of the id, ego, and super-ego.[112] in order to develop a taxonomy of personality constructs, trait theorists, in contrast, attempt to describe the personality sphere in terms of a discrete number of key traits using the statistical data-reduction method of factor analysis. although the number of proposed traits has varied widely, an early biologically-based model proposed by hans eysenck, the 3rd mostly highly cited psychologist of the 20th century (after freud, and piaget respectively), suggested that at least three major trait constructs are necessary to describe human personality structure: extraversion–introversion, neuroticism-stability, and psychoticism-normality. raymond cattell, the 7th most highly cited psychologist of the 20th century (based on the scientific peer-reviewed journal literature)[113] empirically derived a theory of 16 personality factors at the primary-factor level, and up to 8 broader second-stratum factors (at the eysenckian level of analysis), rather than the \"big five\" dimensions.[114][115][116][117] dimensional models of personality are receiving increasing support, and a version of dimensional assessment has been included in the dsm-v. however, despite a plethora of research into the various versions of the \"big five\" personality dimensions, it appears necessary to move on from static conceptualizations of personality structure to a more dynamic orientation, whereby it is acknowledged that personality constructs are subject to learning and change across the lifespan.[118][119]\\n\\nan early example of personality assessment was the woodworth personal data sheet, constructed during world war i. the popular, although psychometrically inadequate myers–briggs type indicator[120] sought to assess individuals\\' \"personality types\" according to the personality theories of carl jung. behaviorist resistance to introspection led to the development of the strong vocational interest blank and minnesota multiphasic personality inventory (mmpi), in an attempt to ask empirical questions that focused less on the psychodynamics of the respondent.[121] however, the mmpi has been subjected to critical scrutiny, given that it adhered to archaic psychiatric nosology, and since it required individuals to provide subjective, introspective responses to the hundreds of items pertaining to psychopathology.[122]\\n\\nunconscious mind\\nsee also: unconscious mind § psychology\\nstudy of the unconscious mind, a part of the psyche outside the awareness of the individual which nevertheless influenced thoughts and behavior was a hallmark of early psychology. in one of the first psychology experiments conducted in the united states, c.s. peirce and joseph jastrow found in 1884 that subjects could choose the minutely heavier of two weights even if consciously uncertain of the difference.[123] freud popularized this concept, with terms like freudian slip entering popular culture, to mean an uncensored intrusion of unconscious thought into one\\'s speech and action. his 1901 text the psychopathology of everyday life catalogues hundreds of everyday events which freud explains in terms of unconscious influence. pierre janet advanced the idea of a subconscious mind, which could contain autonomous mental elements unavailable to the scrutiny of the subject.[124]\\n\\nbehaviorism notwithstanding, the unconscious mind has maintained its importance in psychology. cognitive psychologists have used a \"filter\" model of attention, according to which much information processing takes place below the threshold of consciousness, and only certain processes, limited by nature and by simultaneous quantity, make their way through the filter. copious research has shown that subconscious priming of certain ideas can covertly influence thoughts and behavior.[124] a significant hurdle in this research is proving that a subject\\'s conscious mind has not grasped a certain stimulus, due to the unreliability of self-reporting. for this reason, some psychologists prefer to distinguish between implicit and explicit memory. in another approach, one can also describe a subliminal stimulus as meeting an objective but not a subjective threshold.[125]\\n\\nthe automaticity model, which became widespread following exposition by john bargh and others in the 1980s, describes sophisticated processes for executing goals which can be selected and performed over an extended duration without conscious awareness.[126][127] some experimental data suggests that the brain begins to consider taking actions before the mind becomes aware of them.[125][128] this influence of unconscious forces on people\\'s choices naturally bears on philosophical questions free will. john bargh, daniel wegner, and ellen langer are some prominent contemporary psychologists who describe free will as an illusion.[126][127][129]\\n\\nmotivation\\nmain article: motivation\\npsychologists such as william james initially used the term motivation to refer to intention, in a sense similar to the concept of will in european philosophy. with the steady rise of darwinian and freudian thinking, instinct also came to be seen as a primary source of motivation.[130] according to drive theory, the forces of instinct combine into a single source of energy which exerts a constant influence. psychoanalysis, like biology, regarded these forces as physical demands made by the organism on the nervous system. however, they believed that these forces, especially the sexual instincts, could become entangled and transmuted within the psyche. classical psychoanalysis conceives of a struggle between the pleasure principle and the reality principle, roughly corresponding to id and ego. later, in beyond the pleasure principle, freud introduced the concept of the death drive, a compulsion towards aggression, destruction, and psychic repetition of traumatic events.[131] meanwhile, behaviorist researchers used simple dichotomous models (pleasure/pain, reward/punishment) and well-established principles such as the idea that a thirsty creature will take pleasure in drinking.[130][132] clark hull formalized the latter idea with his drive reduction model.[133]\\n\\nhunger, thirst, fear, sexual desire, and thermoregulation all seem to constitute fundamental motivations for animals.[132] humans also seem to exhibit a more complex set of motivations—though theoretically these could be explained as resulting from primordial instincts—including desires for belonging, self-image, self-consistency, truth, love, and control.[134][135]\\n\\nmotivation can be modulated or manipulated in many different ways. researchers have found that eating, for example, depends not only on the organism\\'s fundamental need for homeostasis—an important factor causing the experience of hunger—but also on circadian rhythms, food availability, food palatability, and cost.[132] abstract motivations are also malleable, as evidenced by such phenomena as goal contagion: the adoption of goals, sometimes unconsciously, based on inferences about the goals of others.[136] vohs and baumeister suggest that contrary to the need-desire-fulfilment cycle of animal instincts, human motivations sometimes obey a \"getting begets wanting\" rule: the more you get a reward such as self-esteem, love, drugs, or money, the more you want it. they suggest that this principle can even apply to food, drink, sex, and sleep.[137]\\n\\ndevelopment\\nmain article: developmental psychology\\n\\ndevelopmental psychologists would engage a child with a book and then make observations based on how the child interacts with the object.\\nmainly focusing on the development of the human mind through the life span, developmental psychology seeks to understand how people come to perceive, understand, and act within the world and how these processes change as they age. this may focus on cognitive, affective, moral, social, or neural development. researchers who study children use a number of unique research methods to make observations in natural settings or to engage them in experimental tasks. such tasks often resemble specially designed games and activities that are both enjoyable for the child and scientifically useful, and researchers have even devised clever methods to study the mental processes of infants. in addition to studying children, developmental psychologists also study aging and processes throughout the life span, especially at other times of rapid change (such as adolescence and old age). developmental psychologists draw on the full range of psychological theories to inform their research.[citation needed]\\n\\ngenes and environment\\nmain article: behavioral genetics\\nall researched psychological traits are influenced by both genes and environment, to varying degrees.[138][139] these two sources of influence are often confounded in observational research of individuals or families. an example is the transmission of depression from a depressed mother to her offspring. theory may hold that the offspring, by virtue of having a depressed mother in his or her (the offspring\\'s) environment, is at risk for developing depression. however, risk for depression is also influenced to some extent by genes. the mother may both carry genes that contribute to her depression but will also have passed those genes on to her offspring thus increasing the offspring\\'s risk for depression. genes and environment in this simple transmission model are completely confounded. experimental and quasi-experimental behavioral genetic research uses genetic methodologies to disentangle this confound and understand the nature and origins of individual differences in behavior.[75] traditionally this research has been conducted using twin studies and adoption studies, two designs where genetic and environmental influences can be partially un-confounded. more recently, the availability of microarray molecular genetic or genome sequencing technologies allows researchers to measure participant dna variation directly, and test whether individual genetic variants within genes are associated with psychological traits and psychopathology through methods including genome-wide association studies. one goal of such research is similar to that in positional cloning and its success in huntington\\'s: once a causal gene is discovered biological research can be conducted to understand how that gene influences the phenotype. one major result of genetic association studies is the general finding that psychological traits and psychopathology, as well as complex medical diseases, are highly polygenic,[140][141][142][143][144] where a large number (on the order of hundreds to thousands) of genetic variants, each of small effect, contribute to individual differences in the behavioral trait or propensity to the disorder. active research continues to understand the genetic and environmental bases of behavior and their interaction.\\n\\napplications\\nfurther information: outline of psychology, list of psychology disciplines, applied psychology, and subfields of psychology\\npsychology encompasses many subfields and includes different approaches to the study of mental processes and behavior:\\n\\nmental testing\\nsee also: psychometrics and social statistics\\npsychological testing has ancient origins, such as examinations for the chinese civil service dating back to 2200 bc. written exams began during the han dynasty (202 bc – ad 200). by 1370, the chinese system required a stratified series of tests, involving essay writing and knowledge of diverse topics. the system was ended in 1906.[145] in europe, mental assessment took a more physiological approach, with theories of physiognomy—judgment of character based on the face—described by aristotle in 4th century bc greece. physiognomy remained current through the enlightenment, and added the doctrine of phrenology: a study of mind and intelligence based on simple assessment of neuroanatomy.[146]\\n\\nwhen experimental psychology came to britain, francis galton was a leading practitioner, and, with his procedures for measuring reaction time and sensation, is considered an inventor of modern mental testing (also known as psychometrics).[147] james mckeen cattell, a student of wundt and galton, brought the concept to the united states, and in fact coined the term \"mental test\".[148] in 1901, cattell\\'s student clark wissler published discouraging results, suggesting that mental testing of columbia and barnard students failed to predict their academic performance.[148] in response to 1904 orders from the minister of public instruction, french psychologists alfred binet and théodore simon elaborated a new test of intelligence in 1905–1911, using a range of questions diverse in their nature and difficulty. binet and simon introduced the concept of mental age and referred to the lowest scorers on their test as idiots. henry h. goddard put the binet-simon scale to work and introduced classifications of mental level such as imbecile and feebleminded. in 1916 (after binet\\'s death), stanford professor lewis m. terman modified the binet-simon scale (renamed the stanford–binet scale) and introduced the intelligence quotient as a score report.[149] from this test, terman concluded that mental retardation \"represents the level of intelligence which is very, very common among spanish-indians and mexican families of the southwest and also among negroes. their dullness seems to be racial.\"[150]\\n\\nfollowing the army alpha and army beta tests for soldiers in world war i, mental testing became popular in the us, where it was soon applied to school children. the federally created national intelligence test was administered to 7 million children in the 1920s, and in 1926 the college entrance examination board created the scholastic aptitude test to standardize college admissions.[151] the results of intelligence tests were used to argue for segregated schools and economic functions—i.e. the preferential training of black americans for manual labor. these practices were criticized by black intellectuals such a horace mann bond and allison davis.[150] eugenicists used mental testing to justify and organize compulsory sterilization of individuals classified as mentally retarded.[42] in the united states, tens of thousands of men and women were sterilized. setting a precedent which has never been overturned, the u.s. supreme court affirmed the constitutionality of this practice in the 1907 case buck v. bell.[152]\\n\\ntoday mental testing is a routine phenomenon for people of all ages in western societies.[153] modern testing aspires to criteria including standardization of procedure, consistency of results, output of an interpretable score, statistical norms describing population outcomes, and, ideally, effective prediction of behavior and life outcomes outside of testing situations.[154]\\n\\nmental health care\\nthe provision of psychological health services is generally called clinical psychology in the u.s. the definitions of this term are various and may include school psychology and counseling psychology. practitioners typically includes people who have graduated from doctoral programs in clinical psychology but may also include others. in canada, the above groups usually fall within the larger category of professional psychology. in canada and the us, practitioners get bachelor\\'s degrees and doctorates, then spend one year in an internship and one year in postdoctoral education. in mexico and most other latin american and european countries, psychologists do not get bachelor\\'s and doctorate degrees; instead, they take a three-year professional course following high school.[62] clinical psychology is at present the largest specialization within psychology.[155] it includes the study and application of psychology for the purpose of understanding, preventing, and relieving psychologically based distress, dysfunction or mental illness and to promote subjective well-being and personal development. central to its practice are psychological assessment and psychotherapy although clinical psychologists may also engage in research, teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and program development and administration.[156]\\n\\ncredit for the first psychology clinic in the united states typically goes to lightner witmer, who established his practice in philadelphia in 1896. another modern psychotherapist was morton prince.[155] for the most part, in the first part of the twentieth century, most mental health care in the united states was performed by specialized medical doctors called psychiatrists. psychology entered the field with its refinements of mental testing, which promised to improve diagnosis of mental problems. for their part, some psychiatrists became interested in using psychoanalysis and other forms of psychodynamic psychotherapy to understand and treat the mentally ill.[37] in this type of treatment, a specially trained therapist develops a close relationship with the patient, who discusses wishes, dreams, social relationships, and other aspects of mental life. the therapist seeks to uncover repressed material and to understand why the patient creates defenses against certain thoughts and feelings. an important aspect of the therapeutic relationship is transference, in which deep unconscious feelings in a patient reorient themselves and become manifest in relation to the therapist.[157]\\n\\npsychiatric psychotherapy blurred the distinction between psychiatry and psychology, and this trend continued with the rise of community mental health facilities and behavioral therapy, a thoroughly non-psychodynamic model which used behaviorist learning theory to change the actions of patients. a key aspect of behavior therapy is empirical evaluation of the treatment\\'s effectiveness. in the 1970s, cognitive-behavior therapy arose, using similar methods and now including the cognitive constructs which had gained popularity in theoretical psychology. a key practice in behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapy is exposing patients to things they fear, based on the premise that their responses (fear, panic, anxiety) can be deconditioned.[158]\\n\\nmental health care today involves psychologists and social workers in increasing numbers. in 1977, national institute of mental health director bertram brown described this shift as a source of \"intense competition and role confusion\".[37] graduate programs issuing doctorates in psychology (phd or psyd) emerged in the 1950s and underwent rapid increase through the 1980s. this degree is intended to train practitioners who might conduct scientific research.[62]\\n\\nsome clinical psychologists may focus on the clinical management of patients with brain injury—this area is known as clinical neuropsychology. in many countries, clinical psychology is a regulated mental health profession. the emerging field of disaster psychology (see crisis intervention) involves professionals who respond to large-scale traumatic events.[159]\\n\\nthe work performed by clinical psychologists tends to be influenced by various therapeutic approaches, all of which involve a formal relationship between professional and client (usually an individual, couple, family, or small group). typically, these approaches encourage new ways of thinking, feeling, or behaving. four major theoretical perspectives are psychodynamic, cognitive behavioral, existential–humanistic, and systems or family therapy. there has been a growing movement to integrate the various therapeutic approaches, especially with an increased understanding of issues regarding culture, gender, spirituality, and sexual orientation. with the advent of more robust research findings regarding psychotherapy, there is evidence that most of the major therapies have equal effectiveness, with the key common element being a strong therapeutic alliance.[160][161] because of this, more training programs and psychologists are now adopting an eclectic therapeutic orientation.[162][163][164][165][166]\\n\\ndiagnosis in clinical psychology usually follows the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (dsm), a handbook first published by the american psychiatric association in 1952. new editions over time have increased in size and focused more on medical language.[167] the study of mental illnesses is called abnormal psychology.\\n\\neducation\\nmain articles: educational psychology and school psychology\\n\\nan example of an item from a cognitive abilities test used in educational psychology.\\neducational psychology is the study of how humans learn in educational settings, the effectiveness of educational interventions, the psychology of teaching, and the social psychology of schools as organizations. the work of child psychologists such as lev vygotsky, jean piaget, and jerome bruner has been influential in creating teaching methods and educational practices. educational psychology is often included in teacher education programs in places such as north america, australia, and new zealand.\\n\\nschool psychology combines principles from educational psychology and clinical psychology to understand and treat students with learning disabilities; to foster the intellectual growth of gifted students; to facilitate prosocial behaviors in adolescents; and otherwise to promote safe, supportive, and effective learning environments. school psychologists are trained in educational and behavioral assessment, intervention, prevention, and consultation, and many have extensive training in research.[168]\\n\\nwork\\nsee also: industrial and organizational psychology and organizational behavior\\nindustrialists soon brought the nascent field of psychology to bear on the study of scientific management techniques for improving workplace efficiency. this field was at first called economic psychology or business psychology; later, industrial psychology, employment psychology, or psychotechnology.[169] an important early study examined workers at western electric\\'s hawthorne plant in cicero, illinois from 1924–1932. with funding from the laura spelman rockefeller fund and guidance from australian psychologist elton mayo, western electric experimented on thousands of factory workers to assess their responses to illumination, breaks, food, and wages. the researchers came to focus on workers\\' responses to observation itself, and the term hawthorne effect is now used to describe the fact that people work harder when they think they\\'re being watched.[170]\\n\\nthe name industrial and organizational psychology (i–o) arose in the 1960s and became enshrined as the society for industrial and organizational psychology, division 14 of the american psychological association, in 1973.[169] the goal is to optimize human potential in the workplace. personnel psychology, a subfield of i–o psychology, applies the methods and principles of psychology in selecting and evaluating workers. i–o psychology\\'s other subfield, organizational psychology, examines the effects of work environments and management styles on worker motivation, job satisfaction, and productivity.[171] the majority of i–o psychologists work outside of academia, for private and public organizations and as consultants.[169] a psychology consultant working in business today might expect to provide executives with information and ideas about their industry, their target markets, and the organization of their company.[172]\\n\\nmilitary and intelligence\\none role for psychologists in the military is to evaluate and counsel soldiers and other personnel. in the u.s., this function began during world war i, when robert yerkes established the school of military psychology at fort oglethorpe in georgia, to provide psychological training for military staff military.[37][173] today, u.s army psychology includes psychological screening, clinical psychotherapy, suicide prevention, and treatment for post-traumatic stress, as well as other aspects of health and workplace psychology such as smoking cessation.[174]\\n\\npsychologists may also work on a diverse set of campaigns known broadly as psychological warfare. psychological warfare chiefly involves the use of propaganda to influence enemy soldiers and civilians. in the case of so-called black propaganda the propaganda is designed to seem like it originates from a different source.[175] the cia\\'s mkultra program involved more individualized efforts at mind control, involving techniques such as hypnosis, torture, and covert involuntary administration of lsd.[176] the u.s. military used the name psychological operations (psyop) until 2010, when these were reclassified as military information support operations (miso), part of information operations (io).[177] psychologists are sometimes involved in assisting the interrogation and torture of suspects, though this has sometimes been denied by those involved and sometimes opposed by others.[178]\\n\\nhealth, well-being, and social change\\nsee also: health psychology and biopsychosocial model\\nmedical facilities increasingly employ psychologists to perform various roles. a prominent aspect of health psychology is the psychoeducation of patients: instructing them in how to follow a medical regimen. health psychologists can also educate doctors and conduct research on patient compliance.[179]\\n\\npsychologists in the field of public health use a wide variety of interventions to influence human behavior. these range from public relations campaigns and outreach to governmental laws and policies. psychologists study the composite influence of all these different tools in an effort to influence whole populations of people.[180]\\n\\nblack american psychologists kenneth and mamie clark studied the psychological impact of segregation and testified with their findings in the desegregation case brown v. board of education (1954).[181]\\n\\npositive psychology is the study of factors which contribute to human happiness and well-being, focusing more on people who are currently healthy. in 2010, clinical psychological review published a special issue devoted to positive psychological interventions, such as gratitude journaling and the physical expression of gratitude. positive psychological interventions have been limited in scope, but their effects are thought to be superior to that of placebos, especially with regard to helping people with body image problems.\\n\\nresearch methods\\nmain articles: psychological research and list of psychological research methods\\nquantitative psychological research lends itself to the statistical testing of hypotheses. although the field makes abundant use of randomized and controlled experiments in laboratory settings, such research can only assess a limited range of short-term phenomena. thus, psychologists also rely on creative statistical methods to glean knowledge from clinical trials and population data.[182] these include the pearson product–moment correlation coefficient, the analysis of variance, multiple linear regression, logistic regression, structural equation modeling, and hierarchical linear modeling. the measurement and operationalization of important constructs is an essential part of these research designs\\n\\ncontrolled experiments\\nmain article: experiment\\n\\nflowchart of four phases (enrollment, intervention allocation, follow-up, and data analysis) of a parallel randomized trial of two groups, modified from the consort 2010 statement[183]\\n\\nthe experimenter (e) orders the teacher (t), the subject of the experiment, to give what the latter believes are painful electric shocks to a learner (l), who is actually an actor and confederate. the subject believes that for each wrong answer, the learner was receiving actual electric shocks, though in reality there were no such punishments. being separated from the subject, the confederate set up a tape recorder integrated with the electro-shock generator, which played pre-recorded sounds for each shock level etc.[184]\\na true experiment with random allocation of subjects to conditions allows researchers to make strong inferences about causal relationships. in an experiment, the researcher alters parameters of influence, called independent variables, and measures resulting changes of interest, called dependent variables. prototypical experimental research is conducted in a laboratory with a carefully controlled environment.\\n\\nrepeated-measures experiments are those which take place through intervention on multiple occasions. in research on the effectiveness of psychotherapy, experimenters often compare a given treatment with placebo treatments, or compare different treatments against each other. treatment type is the independent variable. the dependent variables are outcomes, ideally assessed in several ways by different professionals.[185] using crossover design, researchers can further increase the strength of their results by testing both of two treatments on two groups of subjects.\\n\\nquasi-experimental design refers especially to situations precluding random assignment to different conditions. researchers can use common sense to consider how much the nonrandom assignment threatens the study\\'s validity.[186] for example, in research on the best way to affect reading achievement in the first three grades of school, school administrators may not permit educational psychologists to randomly assign children to phonics and whole language classrooms, in which case the psychologists must work with preexisting classroom assignments. psychologists will compare the achievement of children attending phonics and whole language classes.\\n\\nexperimental researchers typically use a statistical hypothesis testing model which involves making predictions before conducting the experiment, then assessing how well the data supports the predictions. (these predictions may originate from a more abstract scientific hypothesis about how the phenomenon under study actually works.) analysis of variance (anova) statistical techniques are used to distinguish unique results of the experiment from the null hypothesis that variations result from random fluctuations in data. in psychology, the widely used standard ascribes statistical significance to results which have less than 5% probability of being explained by random variation.[187]\\n\\nother forms of statistical inference\\nstatistical surveys are used in psychology for measuring attitudes and traits, monitoring changes in mood, checking the validity of experimental manipulations, and for other psychological topics. most commonly, psychologists use paper-and-pencil surveys. however, surveys are also conducted over the phone or through e-mail. web-based surveys are increasingly used to conveniently reach many subjects.\\n\\nneuropsychological tests, such as the wechsler scales and wisconsin card sorting test, are mostly questionnaires or simple tasks used which assess a specific type of mental function in the respondent. these can be used in experiments, as in the case of lesion experiments evaluating the results of damage to a specific part of the brain.[188]\\n\\nobservational studies analyze uncontrolled data in search of correlations; multivariate statistics are typically used to interpret the more complex situation. cross-sectional observational studies use data from a single point in time, whereas longitudinal studies are used to study trends across the life span. longitudinal studies track the same people, and therefore detect more individual, rather than cultural, differences. however, they suffer from lack of controls and from confounding factors such as selective attrition (the bias introduced when a certain type of subject disproportionately leaves a study).\\n\\nexploratory data analysis refers to a variety of practices which researchers can use to visualize and analyze existing sets of data. in peirce\\'s three modes of inference, exploratory data analysis corresponds to abduction, or hypothesis formation.[189] meta-analysis is the technique of integrating the results from multiple studies and interpreting the statistical properties of the pooled dataset.[190]\\n\\ntechnological assays\\n\\nan eeg recording setup\\na classic and popular tool used to relate mental and neural activity is the electroencephalogram (eeg), a technique using amplified electrodes on a person\\'s scalp to measure voltage changes in different parts of the brain. hans berger, the first researcher to use eeg on an unopened skull, quickly found that brains exhibit signature \"brain waves\": electric oscillations which correspond to different states of consciousness. researchers subsequently refined statistical methods for synthesizing the electrode data, and identified unique brain wave patterns such as the delta wave observed during non-rem sleep.[191]\\n\\nnewer functional neuroimaging techniques include functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography, both of which track the flow of blood through the brain. these technologies provide more localized information about activity in the brain and create representations of the brain with widespread appeal. they also provide insight which avoids the classic problems of subjective self-reporting. it remains challenging to draw hard conclusions about where in the brain specific thoughts originate—or even how usefully such localization corresponds with reality. however, neuroimaging has delivered unmistakable results showing the existence of correlations between mind and brain. some of these draw on a systemic neural network model rather than a localized function model.[192][193][194]\\n\\npsychiatric interventions such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and drugs also provide information about brain–mind interactions. psychopharmacology is the study of drug-induced mental effects.\\n\\n\\nartificial neural network with two layers, an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain.\\ncomputer simulation\\nsee also: computational cognition\\ncomputational modeling is a tool used in mathematical psychology and cognitive psychology to simulate behavior.[195] this method has several advantages. since modern computers process information quickly, simulations can be run in a short time, allowing for high statistical power. modeling also allows psychologists to visualize hypotheses about the functional organization of mental events that couldn\\'t be directly observed in a human. computational neuroscience uses mathematical models to simulate the brain. another method is symbolic modeling, which represents many mental objects using variables and rules. other types of modeling include dynamic systems and stochastic modeling.\\n\\nanimal studies\\n\\na rat undergoing a morris water navigation test used in behavioral neuroscience to study the role of the hippocampus in spatial learning and memory.\\nanimal experiments aid in investigating many aspects of human psychology, including perception, emotion, learning, memory, and thought, to name a few. in the 1890s, russian physiologist ivan pavlov famously used dogs to demonstrate classical conditioning. non-human primates, cats, dogs, pigeons, rats, and other rodents are often used in psychological experiments. ideally, controlled experiments introduce only one independent variable at a time, in order to ascertain its unique effects upon dependent variables. these conditions are approximated best in laboratory settings. in contrast, human environments and genetic backgrounds vary so widely, and depend upon so many factors, that it is difficult to control important variables for human subjects. there are pitfalls in generalizing findings from animal studies to humans through animal models.[196]\\n\\ncomparative psychology refers to the scientific study of the behavior and mental processes of non-human animals, especially as these relate to the phylogenetic history, adaptive significance, and development of behavior. research in this area explores the behavior of many species, from insects to primates. it is closely related to other disciplines that study animal behavior such as ethology.[197] research in comparative psychology sometimes appears to shed light on human behavior, but some attempts to connect the two have been quite controversial, for example the sociobiology of e.o. wilson.[198] animal models are often used to study neural processes related to human behavior, e.g. in cognitive neuroscience.\\n\\nqualitative and descriptive research\\nresearch designed to answer questions about the current state of affairs such as the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of individuals is known as descriptive research. descriptive research can be qualitative or quantitative in orientation. qualitative research is descriptive research that is focused on observing and describing events as they occur, with the goal of capturing all of the richness of everyday behavior and with the hope of discovering and understanding phenomena that might have been missed if only more cursory examinations have been made.\\n\\nqualitative psychological research methods include interviews, first-hand observation, and participant observation. creswell (2003) identifies five main possibilities for qualitative research, including narrative, phenomenology, ethnography, case study, and grounded theory. qualitative researchers[199] sometimes aim to enrich interpretations or critiques of symbols, subjective experiences, or social structures. sometimes hermeneutic and critical aims can give rise to quantitative research, as in erich fromm\\'s study of nazi voting[citation needed] or stanley milgram\\'s studies of obedience to authority.\\n\\n\\nphineas p. gage survived an accident in which a large iron rod was driven completely through his head, destroying much of his brain\\'s left frontal lobe, and is remembered for that injury\\'s reported effects on his personality and behavior.[200]\\njust as jane goodall studied chimpanzee social and family life by careful observation of chimpanzee behavior in the field, psychologists conduct naturalistic observation of ongoing human social, professional, and family life. sometimes the participants are aware they are being observed, and other times the participants do not know they are being observed. strict ethical guidelines must be followed when covert observation is being carried out.\\n\\nprogram evaluation\\nprogram evaluation is a systematic method for collecting, analyzing, and using information to answer questions about projects, policies and programs,[201] particularly about their effectiveness and efficiency. in both the public and private sectors, stakeholders often want to know whether the programs they are funding, implementing, voting for, receiving or objecting to are producing the intended effect. while program evaluation first focuses around this definition, important considerations often include how much the program costs per participant, how the program could be improved, whether the program is worthwhile, whether there are better alternatives, if there are unintended outcomes, and whether the program goals are appropriate and useful.[202]\\n\\ncontemporary issues in methodology and practice\\nmetascience\\nthe field of metascience has revealed significant problems with the methodology of psychological research. psychological research suffers from high bias,[203] low reproducibility,[204] and widespread misuse of statistics.[205] these finding have led to calls for reform from within and from outside the scientific community.[206]\\n\\nconfirmation bias\\nin 1959, statistician theodore sterling examined the results of psychological studies and discovered that 97% of them supported their initial hypotheses, implying a possible publication bias.[207][208][209] similarly, fanelli (2010)[210] found that 91.5% of psychiatry/psychology studies confirmed the effects they were looking for, and concluded that the odds of this happening (a positive result) was around five times higher than in fields such as space- or geosciences. fanelli argues that this is because researchers in \"softer\" sciences have fewer constraints to their conscious and unconscious biases.\\n\\nreplication\\nfurther information: replication crisis § in psychology\\nover the subsequent few years, a replication crisis in psychology was identified, where it was publicly noted that many notable findings in the field had not been replicated and with some researchers being accused of outright fraud in their results.[211][212][213] more systematic efforts to assess the extent of the problem, such as the reproducibility project of the center for open science, found that as many as two-thirds of highly publicized findings in psychology had failed to be replicated,[214] with reproducibility being generally stronger in studies and journals representing cognitive psychology than social psychology topics,[214] and the subfields of differential psychology (including general intelligence and big five personality traits research),[215][216] behavioral genetics (except for candidate gene and candidate gene-by-environment interaction research on behavior and mental illness),[217][218] and the related field of behavioral economics being largely unaffected by the replication crisis.[219] other subfields of psychology that have been implicated by the replication crisis are clinical psychology,[220][221] developmental psychology (particularly cognitive and personality development),[222][223][224] and a field closely related to psychology that has also been implicated is educational research.[225][226][227]\\n\\nfocus on the replication crisis has led to other renewed efforts in the discipline to re-test important findings,[228][229] and in response to concerns about publication bias and p-hacking, more than 140 psychology journals have adopted result-blind peer review where studies are accepted not on the basis of their findings and after the studies are completed, but before the studies are conducted and upon the basis of the methodological rigor of their experimental designs and the theoretical justifications for their statistical analysis techniques before data collection or analysis is done.[230] in addition, large-scale collaborations between researchers working in multiple labs in different countries and that regularly make their data openly available for different researchers to assess have become much more common in the field.[231] early analysis of such reforms has estimated that 61 percent of result-blind studies have led to null results, in contrast to an estimated 5 to 20 percent in earlier research.[232]\\n\\nmisuse of statistics\\nfurther information: misuse of statistics and misuse of p-values\\nsome critics view statistical hypothesis testing as misplaced. psychologist and statistician jacob cohen wrote in 1994 that psychologists routinely confuse statistical significance with practical importance, enthusiastically reporting great certainty in unimportant facts.[233] some psychologists have responded with an increased use of effect size statistics, rather than sole reliance on p-values.[citation needed]\\n\\nweird bias\\n\"weird\" redirects here. for other uses, see weird.\\nin 2008, arnett pointed out that most articles in american psychological association journals were about us populations when u.s. citizens are only 5% of the world\\'s population. he complained that psychologists had no basis for assuming psychological processes to be universal and generalizing research findings to the rest of the global population.[234] in 2010, henrich, heine, and norenzayan reported a systemic bias in conducting psychology studies with participants from \"weird\" (western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic) societies.[235][236] although only 1/8 people worldwide live in regions that fall into the weird classification, the researchers claimed that 60–90% of psychology studies are performed on participants from these areas. the article gave examples of results that differ significantly between people from weird and tribal cultures, including the müller-lyer illusion. arnett (2008), altmaier and hall (2008), and morgan-consoli et al. (2018) saw the western bias in research and theory as a serious problem considering psychologists are increasingly applying psychological principles developed in weird regions in their research, clinical work, and consultation with populations around the world.[234][237][238] in 2018, rad, martingano & ginges showed that nearly a decade after henrich et al.\\'s paper, over 80% of the samples used in studies published in the journal, psychological science, were from the weird population. moreover, their analysis showed that several studies did not fully disclose the origin of their samples, and the authors offer a set of recommendations to editors and reviewers to reduce the weird bias.[239]\\n\\nfrom an anthropological perspective, scholars applied the weird model to european history, arguing that a powerful christian church forced a radical change away from incest and cousin marriages that undermined the role of clans and created individualism in europe by 1500 ce. they argue that a distinctive western psychology thus emerged that valued agency, autonomy, and kindness toward stranger.[240] historians were not involved in that project, and have since pointed out its historical fallacies regarding an all-powerful church at too early a point in time, and a rejection of cousin marriage that did not happen.[241]\\n\\nunscientific mental health training\\nsome observers perceive a gap between scientific theory and its application—in particular, the application of unsupported or unsound clinical practices.[242] critics say there has been an increase in the number of mental health training programs that do not instill scientific competence.[243] practices such as \"facilitated communication for infantile autism\"; memory-recovery techniques including body work; and other therapies, such as rebirthing and reparenting, may be dubious or even dangerous, despite their popularity.[244] in 1984, allen neuringer made a similar point[vague] regarding the experimental analysis of behavior.[245] psychologists, sometimes divided along the lines of laboratory vs. clinic, continue to debate these issues.[246]\\n\\nethics\\nethical standards in the discipline have changed over time. some famous past studies are today considered unethical and in violation of established codes the canadian code of conduct for research involving humans, and the belmont report).\\n\\nthe most important contemporary standards are informed and voluntary consent. after world war ii, the nuremberg code was established because of nazi abuses of experimental subjects. later, most countries (and scientific journals) adopted the declaration of helsinki. in the u.s., the national institutes of health established the institutional review board in 1966, and in 1974 adopted the national research act (hr 7724). all of these measures encouraged researchers to obtain informed consent from human participants in experimental studies. a number of influential studies led to the establishment of this rule; such studies included the mit and fernald school radioisotope studies, the thalidomide tragedy, the willowbrook hepatitis study, and stanley milgram\\'s studies of obedience to authority.\\n\\nhumans\\nuniversity psychology departments have ethics committees dedicated to the rights and well-being of research subjects. researchers in psychology must gain approval of their research projects before conducting any experiment to protect the interests of human participants and laboratory animals.[247]\\n\\nthe ethics code of the american psychological association originated in 1951 as \"ethical standards of psychologists\". this code has guided the formation of licensing laws in most american states. it has changed multiple times over the decades since its adoption. in 1989, the apa revised its policies on advertising and referral fees to negotiate the end of an investigation by the federal trade commission. the 1992 incarnation was the first to distinguish between \"aspirational\" ethical standards and \"enforceable\" ones. members of the public have a five-year window to file ethics complaints about apa members with the apa ethics committee; members of the apa have a three-year window.[248]\\n\\nsome of the ethical issues considered most important are the requirement to practice only within the area of competence, to maintain confidentiality with the patients, and to avoid sexual relations with them. another important principle is informed consent, the idea that a patient or research subject must understand and freely choose a procedure they are undergoing.[248] some of the most common complaints against clinical psychologists include sexual misconduct, and involvement in child custody evaluations.[248]\\n\\nother animals\\ncurrent ethical guidelines state that using non-human animals for scientific purposes is only acceptable when the harm (physical or psychological) done to animals is outweighed by the benefits of the research.[249] keeping this in mind, psychologists can use certain research techniques on animals that could not be used on humans.\\n\\nan experiment by stanley milgram raised questions about the ethics of scientific experimentation because of the extreme emotional stress suffered by the participants. it measured the willingness of study participants to obey an authority figure who instructed them to perform acts that conflicted with their personal conscience.[250]\\ncomparative psychologist harry harlow drew moral condemnation for isolation experiments on rhesus macaque monkeys at the university of wisconsin–madison in the 1970s.[251] the aim of the research was to produce an animal model of clinical depression. harlow also devised what he called a \"rape rack\", to which the female isolates were tied in normal monkey mating posture.[252] in 1974, american literary critic wayne c. booth wrote that, \"harry harlow and his colleagues go on torturing their nonhuman primates decade after decade, invariably proving what we all knew in advance—that social creatures can be destroyed by destroying their social ties.\" he writes that harlow made no mention of the criticism of the morality of his work.[253]\\n'"
